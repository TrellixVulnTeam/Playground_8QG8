刮一下你的鼻子

28

感谢上帝

名字和详细信息

41

团队会窃取这些信息

42
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,450
然后通过隐藏耳麦
and they feed it back to Van Rhys

43
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,370
反馈给范瑞斯  就是我刚刚黑进去的
through a hidden earpiece, which I just hacked into

44
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,220
{\an8}舞台

45
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,830
瞧  这就是灵媒

我的血好疼  妈妈

47
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,080
我的血好疼
My blood hurts.

48
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,780
他为什么这么说
Why is he saying that?

49
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,660
他得了白血病
He had leukemia.

50
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,080
可怜的小家伙
Poor little lamb.

51
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,660
他的笑容好调皮  对吧
Oh, he's got a cheeky little smile, hasn't he?

52
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,490
是的
Yes.

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,410
孩子总是最好联接的
Children often make the best connection

54
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,370
因为他们很纯洁
because they're so pure, you see.

55
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,410
他是个好孩子
He was such a good boy.

56
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,660
他还是  亲爱的  他还是个好孩子

他说他很开心

58
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,370
但他很想念你做的饭

59
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,240
女士们先生们  抱歉打扰了

62
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,080
范瑞斯先生  我们有...

63
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,870
范瑞斯先生  我们有证据
Mr. Van Rhys, we have got proof

64
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,490
证实你通过隐藏耳机获取信息
that you are being fed information through a hidden earpiece

65
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,990
然后假装你能和死者沟通
and you are passing it off as contact with the dead...

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,410
-不好意思  先生  -不好意思
- Excuse me, sir. - I beg your pardon.

67
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,200
这将会在全国电视台直播
This is gonna be broadcast on national television.

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,160
你否认你使用了耳机吗
Can you deny that you were using an earpiece?

69
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,450
那是诽谤
That's slander.

70
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,530
你绝对会收到
I can assure you, you will be hearing

71
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,990
我的律师函
from my solicitor in due course.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,370
他的助手刚刚告诉他罗宾
His assistant just told him that Robbie

73
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,450
曾在基督城医院住院

74
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,740
我可以给你播放录音
I can play you the tape.

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,330
不好意思  基督城医院
I'm sorry. Christchurch Hospital!

76
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,370
他在撒谎吧
He's lyin', isn't he?

77
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,620
难以接受挚爱的人死去
The idea of us and our loved ones dying

78
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,240
就此消失在世上
just ceasing to exist is so awful

79
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,580
让我们相信可能会有灵魂
that we'll believe anything which gives us hope

80
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,450
能给与我们希望
that there might be something beyond.

81
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,660
这种恐惧被称为存在主义恐怖
That fear is known as existential terror

82
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,540
发明这种说法的人是查尔斯·卡梅隆博士
and the man who coined that phrase was Dr. Charles Cameron.

83
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,030
你为什么觉得
So why do you think

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,910
是通过你发声的呢  珍
the voices come through you, Jean?

85
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,140
{\an8}查尔斯·卡梅隆  心理学家

86
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,450
因为我们爱她
'Cause we love her.

87
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,620
有多少种声音
And how many voices are there?

88
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,540
300.

89
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,200
我搬了回来  以为能帮她
I moved back in. I thought it would help.

90
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,740
她没酒喝的时候才会回来
She's only here 'cause she ran out of booze.

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,740
妈妈
Mom.

92
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,740
她昨天晚上想着约翰·特拉沃尔塔自慰
She fingered herself last night thinkin' about John Travolta.

93
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,370
爸爸什么都看得到
Daddy sees everything.

94
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,370
上帝啊
Jesus!

95
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,080
我遇到过这种情况
I've seen this before.

96
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,740
你妈妈在你父亲死后
Your mother feels abandoned

97
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,740
觉得自己遭到抛弃
at the death of your father.

98
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,990
她被附身了吗
Is she possessed?

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,660
不  她很生气自己的丈夫死了
No, she's angry that her husband had died.

100
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,990
至于花瓶...
As for the vase..

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,700
是我干的
...I did that.

102
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,410
大脑只会看到它想看到的
The brain sees what it wants to see.

103
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,660
我小时候看到这个片段时
When I saw that clip when I was a boy

104
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,330
我就像被闪电击中了
it was like a lightning bolt struck me

105
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,200
因为这就像是有人告诉我
'cause it was like somebody saying

106
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,660
你不用这辈子都生活在迷信恐惧之下
you don't have to have your life ruled by superstitious fear.

107
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,370
而我从小到大耳濡目染的...
And the way that I'd been brought up, that was..

108
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,660
说实话  这简直就是一种启示  因为我当时
Honestly, that was a revelation 'cause I didn't realize

109
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,700
都不知道原来还有其它解释
there was a different way of thinking.

110
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,910
从那时候起
And, uh, from that minute

111
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,160
我能记得我当时就想我要做这样的事
I... I can remember thinking that's what I wanna do

112
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,030
我想要做这样的事  做这样的人
that's what I wanna be, that's who I want to be.

113
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,650
{\an8}北部新闻

114
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,660
失踪科学家和超自然主义者
The search for the missing scientist

115
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,780
查尔斯·卡梅隆的车发现被遗弃在
and paranormalist, Charles Cameron, has been called off

116
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,620
他位于法利的家附近  三个月后  对他的搜寻
three weeks after Mr. Cameron's car was found abandoned

117
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,450
宣告取消
near his house in Filey.

118
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,660
我觉得这也算是一种讽刺吧
I think it's ironic to say the least

119
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,160
一个毕生都在解释谜团的人
that a man who spent a lifetime

120
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,330
最后自己也成为了一个谜
explaining away mysteries became one himself.

121
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,870
我只是希望我能亲眼见到他
I just wish I could have met him is all.

122
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,170

I'm sure you're surprised to hear my voice.

126
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,330
我知道你所做的工作  我需要见你
I'm familiar with your work and I need to see you.

127
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,660

Hello, I'm Philip Goodman.

142
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

143
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,490
我真是不敢相信
I can't quite believe this.

144
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,200
是吗  为什么
No? Why is that?

145
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,870
我想和大家一样  我只是...
I think like everybody else, I just pre..

146
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,450
只是以为你死了
...sort of presumed you were dead.

147
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,790
你怎么知道我没死呢
How do you know I'm not?

148
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,160
我能问问  你都去哪里了吗
Can I ask what, where you've been?

149
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,700
-发生了什么  -那就给我倒一杯
- What's happened? - Pour me a drink then.

150
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,740
从那个瓶子里
Pour it from that bottle there.

151
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,450
那个瓶子  倒一杯
Bottle there. Pour it!

152
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,790
好
Okay.

153
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,950
我给你带了点东西
I brought you something.

154
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,830
是我最新出版的书
It's a copy of my latest book.

155
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,970
我签了名...
I signed it...

156
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,830
放在这里了
Just stick it there.

157
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,740
你的著作我全都看过
I'm so familiar with your books

158
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,950
还有你的节目
and your, your TV work.

159
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,830
我总是觉得和你很亲近
I've always felt a closeness to you.

160
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,580
这些煽情之词留给你的妻子和家人吧
Save those sentiments for your wife and family.

161
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,700
你居然未婚
What a surprise. You're not married.

162
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,830
你总是能看清真相
You could always see the truth, couldn't you?

163
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,080
真相
Truth?

164
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,870
我现在回头看我所做的工作
I look back now at my work

165
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,870
只有满满的羞耻
with absolute shame.

166
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,950
我看到我走进那些家庭时
I see the arrogance and the disrespect

167
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,990
所抱有的自大和蔑视
with which I went into those homes.

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,910
我乐于用那些故事让他们彼此疏离
I took pleasure in pulling those stories those people apart.

169
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,410
我觉得你对你自己太苛刻了
I think you're being really hard on yourself.

170
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,580
我看过你所做的工作  古德曼
I have seen your work, Goodman.

171
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,910
你想知道我怎么想的吗
You want to know what I think of it?

172
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,950
一团糟
It's shit.

173
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,990
你是个自负  软弱的懦夫
You are a conceited, weak-willed coward.

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,330
篡改对你不利的数据
Editing out any inconvenient data.

175
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,950
害怕接受任何不符合
Terrified of anything that doesn't fit

176
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,660
你那渺小世界观的...
into your tiny worldview...

177
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,870
我受够了  我抱着对你的崇敬...
Okay, I'm done. I came here in good faith because you...

178
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,030
三个案子
Three cases!

179
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,060
{\an8}解释这些

180
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,490
我无法解释这三个案子
I couldn't explain three cases

181
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,330
困扰我至今
that haunt me still.

182
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,370
如果你有胆量的话就去调查
Now you go and investigate if you dare

183
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,700
再回来告诉我我错了
and come back and tell me that I am wrong

184
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,030
因为我只能得出一个结论
because I've come to one inescapable conclusion

185
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,870
我们身边有
and that is the supernatural

186
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,780
看不到的超自然力
the unseen forces that surround us

187
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,580
你和我穷其一生
everything that you and I have spent a lifetime

188
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,870
想要推翻和揭穿的一切  都是真的
trying to debunk and disprove, it's all true.

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,830
全都是真的
Every last bit of it.

190
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,910
拜托  古德曼先生
Please, Mr. Goodman.

191
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,830
我求求你
I'm begging you.

192
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,160
告诉我  我错了
Tell me I am wrong.

193
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,500
我需要你告诉我
I need you to tell me..

194
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,910
我错了
...I'm wrong.

195
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,230
{\an8}第一个案子
托尼·马修斯

196
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,660
你好  托尼
Oh, hello, Tony?

197
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,030
船长
Aye, captain.

198
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,990
你好
Hello there.

199
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
你好  我是菲利普·古德曼
Hi, I'm Philip Goodman.

200
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,780
慢了
Bang! Whoa! Slow.

201
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,160
太慢了
Too slow.

202
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,950
你看上去像一个老师
Yeah, you look like a teacher.

203
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,490
是吗  好吧
Do I? Right.

204
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,620
严格来说  我是一名教授
Um, well, technically, I'm a professor.

205
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,160
他们在我做《灵媒骗局》这档节目时
They bloody insist on calling me that

206
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,080
非得要我这样自称
on that TV show that I do, "Psychic Cheats."

207
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,580
我也是通过那个节目知道你的
Oh, yeah, that's where I know you from.

208
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,200
-对  -对  我看过
- Yeah. - Yeah, I seen that.

209
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,580
太烂了
Yeah, it's shit.

210
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,120
我是跟你开玩笑的  伙计
I'm only joking with you, mate.

211
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,700
我没看过
I ain't seen it.

212
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,870
我听都没听过  宝贝
I have never even heard of it, sunbeam.

213
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,240
-教授  -没错
- Professor, eh? - Yeah.

214
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,950
这是演《潘趣和朱迪》[木偶戏]的人
You know, that's the official title

215
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,330
官方的名头
for someone who does a "Punch And Judy."

216
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,240
你肯定不知道吧
I bet you didn't know that, did you?

217
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,120
-我还真不知道  -对吧
- No, I didn't actually. - There you go then.

218
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,030
教授刚从一个低微的守夜人身上
The professor just learned something

219
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,080
学到了东西
from the humble night watchman.

220
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,410
这就是你的工作吧
And that's what you do, is it?

221
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,700
你是个守夜人
You're a night watchman?

222
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,120
其实我不想谈这个  伙计
Actually, I don't wanna talk about it, mate.

223
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,330
什么
Sorry?

224
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,290
我不是很想聊天  宝贝
I'm just not feeling very chatty, sunbeam.

225
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,250
看在上帝的分上
For fuck's sake.

226
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,240
我是不是忘了跟你说会给你钱的
Oh, did I forget to mention that there was a fee?

227
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,160
-100  -50
- 100 quid. - 50.

228
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
好的
Done.

229
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,080
20, 25..

230
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,160
50.

231
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,160
那就是你的工作吗
So that's what you do, yeah?

232
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,870
你是个守夜人
You're a night watchman?

233
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,080
曾经是的  那件事发生时
Well, I was, you know, when, um, it happened.

234
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,290
-现在呢  -现在
- And now? - Now?

235
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,330
只能说移民局
Let's just say that immigration

236
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,250
让日子不好过了
has made things a bit tough, yeah?

237
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,120
家人呢  你结婚了吗
How about family? You married?

238
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,240
我结婚了15年
I was married for 15 years.

239
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,240
谋杀判的都比这轻吧
You get less for murder, don't you?

240
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,200
你离婚了吗
Did you divorce?

241
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,580
她23年前死了
She died 23 years ago.

242
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,700
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

243
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,580
如果她的病生在现在  那种癌症肯定能治好
If she fell ill now, they'd smash that cancer.

244
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,030
世界不一样了  对吗
Different world, isn't it?

245
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,030
是啊  有孩子吗
Yeah. Any children?

246
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,200
别他妈多管闲事
Mind your own fucking business.

247
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,530
你还有多少个问题  神探酷杰克
How many more of these questions have you got, eh, Kojak?

248
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,500
这比办汽车保险还烦
It's worse than getting car insurance, this.

249
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,080
我有个女儿  玛尼[《神秘美人》]
I got a daughter, Marnie.

250
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,870
我一直很喜欢希区柯克
I was always a big Hitchcock fan.

251
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,780
如果我有个儿子  就给他取名诺曼[《惊魂记》]
If I had had a boy, I would've called him Norman.

252
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,490
-她多少岁了  -她30岁
- How old is she? - She's 30.

253
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,370
那你妻子去世的时候她七岁
Right, so she was seven when your wife died.

254
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,160
肯定很艰难
That must have been tough.

255
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,910
玛尼不是我妻子的女儿
Marnie is not my wife's.

256
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,370
我出过轨
I had a little bit on the side.

257
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,910
能怎么办呢
What are you gonna do, eh?

258
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,950
好吧  你经常会见她吗
Right. You see much of her?

259
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,370
我受够了  这简直是胡扯
Well, I'm done here. This is bullshit.

260
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,580
我以为你想聊我看到的东西
I thought you wanted to talk about what I'd seen.

261
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,370
托尼  我只是想帮你
Tony, I'm just trying to help.

262
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,500
你帮不了我  伙计
You can't help me, mate.

263
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,540
她在医院里
She's in hospital.

264
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,740
她已经住院五年了
She's been in there five years.

265
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,080
该死
Oh, fuck.

266
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,200
他们说那叫闭锁综合征
Locked-in syndrome they call it.

267
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,450
她的眼睛是睁开的  但是
Her eyes are open, but..

268
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:59,250
其余部分都瘫了
...everything else is paralyzed.

269
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,080
如果我去看她  我...我都不知道
If I go and see her, I... I don't know

270
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,040
她知不知道我在那里
if she even knows if I'm there or not.

271
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,830
后来我就不去了
I stopped going in the end.

272
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,200
我承受不了
I couldn't handle it.

273
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,750
我的女儿
My little girl.

274
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

275
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,910
你经常道歉吗
You apologize a lot, don't you?

276
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,000
内心有愧吗
Guilty conscience?

277
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,080
你想
You wanna..

278
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,450
想告诉我你出的事吗
Wanna tell me about your incident?

279
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,830
你会觉得我疯了
You'll think I'm mad.

280
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,250
大家都这么觉得  连我的牧师也一样
Everyone else does. Even my priest.

281
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,830
你不相信  对吗
Ah, you don't believe, do you?

282
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,870
那是我最后一晚工作
It was my last night working that job.

283
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,530
凌晨3点45分
Quarter to 4:00 in the morning.

284
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,500
晚上那个时候最难熬
That is a shit time of night.

285
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,410
就算七年来一直上那一轮班
Even after seven years of doin' that shift

286
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,500
你的身体还是习惯不了
your body never gets used to it.

287
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,240
那地方本来就有渊源
That place had a history.

288
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,200
不是什么好地方
None of it was nice.

289
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,330
几百年前  那是...那是...
Hundreds of years before, it was, um, it was a..

290
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,040
怎么说的来着  女子疯人院
What do you call it? A nuthouse for women.

291
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,120
那地方鱼龙混杂
Mad birds roaming about the place.

292
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,450
老兵  醉鬼
Old brasses, drunks

293
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,990
被搞大肚子的年轻女子
young girls that got themselves knocked up

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,330
没人要  被抛弃的婴儿
newborns that no one wanted, thrown away.

295
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,830
痛苦
Miserable.

296
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,160
那晚之前的一个月
In the month leadin' up to that night

297
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,660
两个外国佬辞职了
two of the new foreign blokes quit.

298
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,620
他们说他们看到了一些东西
They said they had seen things.

299
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,870
你相信他们吗
Did you believe them?

300
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,000
真希望我当时信了  上帝啊
I wish I had. Christ Almighty.

301
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,660
喂  梅里克
Hello? Marek?

302
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,500
你得按住边上的按钮
You have to press the button on the side.

303
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,700
按住边上的黑色大按钮  你这个俄罗斯笨蛋
Press the big black button on the side, you Russian prick.

304
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,160
托尼  我在另一幢楼里
Yo, Tony. I am in other building.

305
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,330
恭喜你  哪一幢楼
Congratulations. Which other building?

306
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,080
蓝色门的那幢楼
Um, the building with the blue door.

307
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,280
好吧  你在三号楼
Alright. You're in building number three.

308
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,530
对对对  我该做什么
Yes, yes, yes. What do I do?

309
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,580
你就干坐个十小时
Well, you sit on your arse for the next 10 hours.

310
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,780
每小时去巡逻一下
Every hour go for a walk round

311
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,660
然后记录
and then chart it.

312
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,530
重新设定我给你的计时器
Set that timer that I gave ya.

313
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,660
除此之外  你想干什么都行
Other than that, you do what you want.

314
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,160
我不知道  看书  下棋  学英语都行
I don't know, read, play chess, learn English.

315
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,240
好的  谢谢你  托尼
Okay. Thank you a lot, Tony.

316
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,040
没事  梅里克  不客气
Alright, Marek. No worries.

317
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,030
然后她端着一杯茶坐下来
And then she sat down with a cup of tea

318
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,870
突然生气了
and just went mad.

319
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,450
她说  "你就是这样子"
"That's typical of you," She said.

320
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,910
"马克大人  只想着你自己
"Lord Muck, always thinkin' of himself.

321
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,490
"根本不会想问问我想不想要..."
"Didn't even cross his mind to ask if I wanted one, so.."

322
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,660
我要来一杯茶
I'm havin' a cup of tea, mate.

323
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,950
你怎么想
What do you reckon?

324
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,530
我自私吗  那就是婚姻吗
Was I selfish? Is that what marriage is?

325
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,080
每次都要泡两杯茶
A lifetime sentence of making

326
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,490
不能泡一杯的无期徒刑
two cups of tea instead of one?

327
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,580
还是说应该来点只属于我的健康时间
Or is it good to grab a bit of healthy me time?

328
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,700
这也许能做润滑剂
It can oil the wheels after all.

329
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,410
你觉得呢
What do you think?

330
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,240
-巴尼特的迈克  你好  -你好  杰夫
- Mike in Barnet, hello. - Hi, Jeff.

331
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,700
听起来很傻  但是我们...我们喜欢
Yeah, it sounds silly, but we like... we like

332
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,030
不管做什么都在一起  不管做什么
doing everything together, whatever it is.

333
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,530
就算只是在周六晚上点个外卖
Even if it is just getting a Chinky on a Saturday night.

334
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,530
干柴烈火  真不错
Ooh, fried rice. Nice.

335
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,620
我们就喜欢窝在电视机前  太完美了
We just love it, slobbing in front of the telly. Perfect.

336
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,580
谢谢你  迈克
Oh, thank you for that, Mike.

337
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,950
你说的是中餐吧
You mean a Chinese, of course, don't you?

338
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,780
我代迈克道个歉
Apologies on Mike's behalf.

339
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,950
但是你说得对
But you're right.

340
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,990
也许那就是秘诀
Maybe that's the secret of all.

341
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,250
怎么...
How did that..

342
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,240
我的确曾经很有钱
...I'd have been worth a fortune.

343
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,160
搞什...
What the..

344
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,080
...你要有这个
...about, you know, you've got to have this

345
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,200
你要有那个
and you've got to have that

346
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,660
然后他们就会忘记最简单的事
and they forget the simple things

347
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,490
比如牵彼此的手
you know, like holding hands.

348
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,160
我的丈夫几年前中风了
My husband had a stroke a few years ago

349
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,450
后来他就一直躺在床上
and, um, he has been bedridden ever since

350
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,080
但是我每天都会去看他
but I see him every day without fail.

351
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,330
我会握住他的手  告诉他...
I hold his hand, I tell him..

352
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,080
这样就说明你是个圣人了吗
Oh, well, that makes you a saint

353
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,200
你这个蠢女人
you silly old bitch.

354
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,790
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus Christ!

355
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,540
该死
Bloody hell.

356
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,830
我不...
I don't..

357
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,870
有人吗
Hello?

358
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,450
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus!

359
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,870
梅里克  梅里克
Marek? Marek?

360
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,240
请回答  我是托尼
Pick up, please, it's Tony.

361
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,410
你好  托尼
Hello, Tony.

362
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,370
听着  你来过我这幢楼吗
Listen, have you been over here to this building?

363
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,040
没有  我在另一幢
Mm, no. I am in other one.

364
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,080
我不喜欢这个地方  托尼
I don't like this place, Tony.

365
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,410
感觉...很糟糕
It feels... bad.

366
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,910
我们对...
We have, um

367
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,950
我们那儿对这种地方有一种叫法
we have a word for this back home.

368
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,200
这里闹鬼
It is zloslivy.

369
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,160
听着  别...
Look, don't, um..

370
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,790
别想些有的没的  伙计
don't let them thoughts get into your head, mate, alright?

371
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,790
听点广播  宝贝
Get yourself a radio, sunbeam. Yeah?

372
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,450
我去转一转
Look, I'm gonna, uh, take a walk around, right?

373
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,870
你坐个十分钟
You sit tight for 10 minutes

374
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,660
等我回来给你打电话  好吗
and I'll call you when I get back, alright?

375
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,660
好的  谢谢你  托尼
Okay. Thank you a lot, Tony.

376
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,000
好的  伙计
Alright, mate.

377
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,790
有人吗
Hello?

378
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,620
有人在吗
Is anyone there?

379
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,950
梅里克  梅里克
Marek? Marek?

380
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,080
爸爸
Dada?

381
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,450
昏迷了  可能是闭锁综合症
It is a coma. A probable lock-in.

382
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,620
他要永远留在这里了
He is here for keeps.

383
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,990
就像那种...
Just one of those things.

384
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,040
灯亮着  却没人在家
The lights are on and nobody's home.

385
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,950
梅里克
Marek?

386
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,080
听着
Right, listen.

387
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,030
给你两分钟离开这幢大楼
You've got two minutes to get out of this buildin'

388
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,870
不然我就来找你了
before I come for ya.

389
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,450
梅里克  如果是你的话...
Marek, if that's you..

390
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,080
怎...真不敢相信
What.. I can't believe this.

391
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,370
有人吗
Hello?

392
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,660
该死的...
Oh, what the bloody..

393
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,450
我可不是好惹的
I'm not fuckin' about.

394
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,080
来啊  来啊
Right. Yeah? Yeah?

395
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,080
该死
Shit.

396
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,240
爸爸
Dada.

397
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,870
我要来找你了
I'm comin' in.

398
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,330
抓到你了
Yeah. I got you now.

399
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,580
放我出去  放我出去
Let me out! Let me out!

400
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,080
该死
Shit.

401
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,950
搞什...
What the..

402
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,410
爸爸
Dada!

403
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,600
{\an8}《圣经》

404
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,490
你知道托尼为什么回教堂吗
Do you know what brought Tony back to the church?

405
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,240
我不是很想这样
Uh, you know, I am not comfortable

406
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,370
直接地谈论一位教区居民
talking so directly about a parishioner.

407
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,030
应该是托尼让你来找我的吧
I'm assuming you have Tony's permission to talk to me?

408
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,490
是的  当然了
Yeah, yeah, of course.

409
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,160
但是如果...
But I can..

410
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,830
如果你感觉不舒服的话  我可以
I mean, I can ask you some more indirect questions

411
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,410
问你一些不那么直接的问题
if you're comfortable with that?

412
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,660
-好的  -太好了
- Yes. - Okay. Great.

413
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,830
那么...
Um, so..

414
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,450
当一个托尼这样的成年男性
So what do you think is your responsibility

415
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,410
来找你说自己遭遇了超自然的事时
when a grown man like Tony comes to you and says

416
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,330
你觉得这是你的责任吗
that they've had a supernatural experience?

417
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,160
当初我做学校牧师的时候
You know, uh, when I was a school's chaplain

418
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,120
我经常和孩子们说
I would always say to the boys

419
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,330
"年龄对上帝来说不重要
"Age is not important to the Lord.

420
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,750
我们在祂面前永远是孩子"
We are all children before Him."

421
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,490
如果祂想让你相信
If He wants you to believe

422
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,910
祂会给你启示
He will send you a sign.

423
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,030
这就是这些经历的本质
That is what these experiences are.

424
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,370
启示
Signs.

425
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,410
当然了  但是...
Sure, but..

426
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,450
托尼身上的事...
Uh, Tony, with Tony, uh..

427
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,740
如果托尼和你说了他的事...
Presumably, Tony told you about his incident?

428
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,780
当然了
Of course.

429
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,780
灵魂  不安的灵魂
The spirit. The unquiet spirit.

430
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,080
没错
Yeah.

431
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,330
我们暂时
So for a moment

432
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,530
假设真的发生了那种事
let's hypothesize that that really happened...

433
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,620
你不用假设
Oh, you do not need to hypothesize.

434
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,280
的确发生了
It did happen.

435
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,740
托尼证实自己看到了灵魂
Tony testifies that he saw a spirit

436
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,450
他也因此改变了
and he changed his ways accordingly.

437
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,370
但是你为什么认为那不是真的
But in what way is that not real?

438
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,030
当然了  在托尼看来如此确凿的事
Oh, of course, for Tony's sighting to be taken seriously

439
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,450
肯定会留下一些具体的物证
there's got to be some sort of material evidence.

440
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,830
不然的话  这就是...
Because without that, it's, uh, you know..

441
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,830
托尼有很多情绪负担
Tony has got so much emotional baggage.

442
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,660
负担  我们...我们谈论的是一个人
Baggage? We... We are talking about a man.

443
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,410
是我们的兄弟
Our brother.

444
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,120
我已经厌烦这种现代
I'm so tired of this modern disregard

445
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
对灵魂的轻视
for the spiritual life.

446
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,370
现代社会已经不流行关心
How unfashionable it's become to believe in anything

447
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,500
自身利益以外的事了
other than our own personal gains.

448
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,530
托尼有没有告诉你他经历了那件事后做了什么
Did Tony tell you what he did after he had that experience?

449
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,700
没有
No.

450
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,330
他又去看他的女儿玛尼了
He went to see his daughter, Marnie, again

451
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,910
就在第二天
the very next day.

452
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,330
当她听到父亲的声音
And when she heard her father's voice

453
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,580
五年来第一次
for the first time in five years

454
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,450
医生说她的心跳漏了一拍
the doctor said her heart skipped a beat.

455
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,120
教授  我觉得那
That, I think, professor

456
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,620
告诉我们了我们
tells us everything we need to know

457
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,450
对这经历所需要明白的现实和其价值所在
about the reality of that experience and its value.

458
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,620
古德曼先生  也请你
You, Mr. Goodman, would do well

459
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,450
借此想想你自己的家庭
to think about that with regard to your own family.

460
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,870
日安
Good day.

461
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,030
{\an8}第二个案子
西蒙·里夫金德

462
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,620
谁啊
Who is it?

463
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,080
我是菲利普·古德曼教授
Uh, it's Professor Philip Goodman.

464
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,910
我们通过电话
We spoke on the phone.

465
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,530
你有身份证之类的东西吗
Do you have an ID or anything?

466
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,120
和我通话的人可能不是你
You might not be the man that I spoke to.

467
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,580
是我
I am.

468
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,370
好吧  给你
Oh, okay. Here you go.

469
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,330
这是你寄给查尔斯·卡梅隆的
You sent that to Charles Cameron.

470
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,540
请进
Come in.

471
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,870
我去楼上了  妈妈
I'll be upstairs, mom.

472
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,790
古德曼教授
Professor Goodman?

473
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,750
西蒙
Simon?

474
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,660
西蒙
Simon?

475
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,750
下面
Down here.

476
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,000
上帝啊
Jesus.

477
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,330
恶魔
Demon.

478
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,540
请坐
Sit down.

479
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,660
请不要碰我的书
Please, don't touch my books.

480
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,740
天啊  这里太热了  西蒙
God, it's boiling in here, Simon.

481
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,660
我知道
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.

482
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,660
我很怕冷
I just get really cold

483
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,830
还会很不舒服
and really uncomfortable

484
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,870
所以我喜欢搞得舒服点...
so I just like it to be as comfort..

485
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,200
我就是喜欢这样
I just like it how I like it.

486
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,370
那么...
Uh, so..

487
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:31,950
这些画...
So what are all these..

488
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,280
这些画都是哪里来的
Where are these pictures from?

489
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,950
这些都是...到处找来的
They're from... They're from all over.

490
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,780
这是我的研究
It's my research.

491
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,120
我在网上找到的
Stuff that I find on the internet

492
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,160
或者我看的书里的
or books that I'm reading.

493
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,370
我感兴趣的东西
Stuff I'm interested in.

494
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,830
我只是想搞清楚一些事
I'm just trying to understand certain things.

495
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,080
所以把这些东西贴出来很有帮助
So it's helpful to have all that stuff out

496
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,620
让我能一直看着
so I can see it all the time.

497
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,870
或者说至少我想看的时候能看到
Or at least whenever I want to see it.

498
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,240
如果我不想看  我可以看那里
If I don't wanna see it, I can look over there.

499
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,280
我不想...
The thing that I don't want..

500
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,830
我不想别人看到我
I don't want people looking at me and thinking

501
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,080
觉得我疯了  因为我知道我看到了什么
that I'm mad 'cause I know what I saw.

502
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,910
就是这样  我累了
And that's the thing. I'm tired.

503
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,870
我太累了  我觉得现在
I'm so tired and I'm finding it hard

504
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:01,990
已经无法保持清醒
to think straight right now.

505
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,200
但是我想谈论这件事
But, I mean, I want to talk about this.

506
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,280
我想查清楚
I wanna find out about this

507
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,160
但我不希望别人认为...
but I don't want people to think..

508
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,780
我只想理清楚所有事
I just want everything to be straight now.

509
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,780
不要模棱两可  不要含糊敷衍
No frayed edges, no loose ends.

510
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,750
一切清楚明了
All straight. All smooth.

511
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,870
我不想...
I don't want...

512
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,620
我不想让人觉得
I don't want people thinking that

513
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,790
我有什么...问题
there's anything wr... wrong with me.

514
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,370
我明白
I see.

515
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,000
你没事吧
You okay?

516
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,790
没事
Yeah.

517
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,910
好吧
Okay.

518
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,700
那...
So...

519
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,160
...我们上面的
...who else is up here with us

520
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,030
楼上房间里的人是谁
in the... in the upstairs room?

521
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,200
没有人  就我们
No one. It's just us.

522
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,580
不  抱歉  楼顶的卧室呢
No, sorry. In the top bedroom?

523
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,240
-我哥哥以前的房间  -好吧  你哥哥
- My brother's old room. - Right. Your brother.

524
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,530
他还住在家里吗
So is he still living at home?

525
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,160
完美先生...
Well, Mr. Perfect...

526
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,620
不了  他25岁  结婚了  他有一套公寓
No, he's 25 and married. He's got a flat.

527
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,580
这里没有别人了  就我们
There's no one here. It's just us.

528
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,620
-抱歉  我刚刚在上面...  -这里没别人了
- Sorry, I was just up... - There's nobody here.

529
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,950
我说了  这里没有别人了
I'm telling you there's nobody here.

530
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,910
你想去看看吗
Do you wanna go and look?

531
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,160
-不  -那就好
- No. - Fine then.

532
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,580
你能离开吗  我们有话要说
Can you go away, please? We're trying to talk.

533
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,330
你跟你父母相处不愉快吗
Do you not get on well with your parents?

534
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,290
他们不关心我
They don't care about me.

535
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,450
我知道你还在门外
I know you're still there!

536
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,620
你能帮我吗
Can you help me?

537
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,870
我试试吧
I'll try.

538
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,700
我要你做的是...
All I need you to do is to just...

539
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,910
...告诉我那天晚上发生的所有事
...just tell me everything you can about that night.

540
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,950
一切
Everything.

541
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,030
要是我理解发生了什么
If I can just understand what happened

542
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,160
那就什么事都没有了
then everything will be fine.

543
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,000
好吧
Okay.

544
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,990
我现在跟过去不一样了...
I'm not the same person now as I was. It's..

545
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,910
这个世界不一样了
The world is n... not the same.

546
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,200
天啊  我觉得自己就是个白痴
Oh, God. I feel like such an idiot.

547
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,660
为什么
Why?

548
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,830
没错
Yeah.

549
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,580
我当时开着爸爸的车
I was driving my dad's car.

550
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,950
我驾考没过
I failed my test

551
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,120
但我太害怕了  不敢告诉他们
but I was too afraid to tell them.

552
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,080
我假装自己通过了
I pretended that I had passed.

553
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,200
我当时无证驾驶
I was driving without a license.

554
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,660
-喂  -你在哪里
- Hello? - Where are you?

555
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,530
我在开车  我派对结束了  在回来的路上
I'm in the car. I am on the way back from the party.

556
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,030
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

557
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,030
他在开车  雷蒙德
He's in the car, Raymond.

558
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,160
我们给你打了很久了  你去哪里了
We've been trying to call you. Where have you been?

559
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,120
抱歉  埃迪家附近没有信号
I... I'm sorry. There's no reception near Eddie's.

560
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,120
我们要担心死了
We've been sitting here on shpilkes.

561
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,780
你几个小时前就该回来了
You should have been back hours ago.

562
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,280
你几个小时前就该回来了
Should have been back hours ago!

563
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,120
雷蒙德  老天  我正...
Oh, Raymond, for God's sake, I'm trying to talk...

564
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,080
喂
Hello?

565
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,370
喂
Hello?

566
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,740
你妈妈睡觉了
Your mother's gone to bed.

567
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,120
我们很失望
We are very upset.

568
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,080
爸爸  不是我挂的电话
Dad, I didn't put the phone down on you.

569
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,030
抱歉  我回家晚了
And I'm sorry that I'm late.

570
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,410
我刚刚看到那该死的大学宿舍申请表
I just found that bloody housing form for university

571
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,120
三周前  你就应该寄出去了
that you should have sent in three weeks ago.

572
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,580
你跟我说你已经寄了
You told me you'd sent it!

573
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,120
我...我记得我已经寄出了
Well, I... I thought... I thought that I had.

574
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,160
你是个大骗子  西蒙
You're a bloody liar, Simon.

575
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,450
你是个骗子
You're a liar.

576
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:49,030
也许你能糊弄你妈妈
You might be able to schmooze your mother

577
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,780
但你糊弄不了我
but you cannot schmooze me.

578
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,410
那个表格的事  你撒谎了
You lied about that form.

579
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,490
你还撒谎了周六工作的事  对不对
You lied about getting that Saturday job, didn't you?

580
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,200
接下来是什么事
What are we gonna find out next?

581
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,910
撒谎你过了驾驶考试吗
That you lied about passing your driving test?

582
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:59,200
-该死  -我告诉你
- Shit. - I'll tell you what.

583
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,160
我已经被你气疯了
I'm sick to the bloody back teeth.

584
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,910
该死
Shit.

585
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,580
你竟敢挂我电话
Don't you put the bloody phone down on me!

586
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,160
我...我没有挂你电话
I... I... I didn't put the phone down on you.

587
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,280
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

588
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,160
天啊  天啊  天啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my..

589
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,330
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

590
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,200
你还好吗
You okay?

591
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,910
天啊
Oh, my God.

592
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,750
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

593
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,080
没信号
No signal.

594
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,120
拜托
Come on.

595
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,160
该死的O2
Fucking O2.

596
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,410
-您好  全国车辆故障中心  -你好
- Hello? National Breakdown. - Hello.

597
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,620
您能告诉我车牌号吗
Can you give me the car's registration, please?

598
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,660
稍等一下
Just give me one second.

599
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,450
AG57-EOZ
AG57-EOZ.

600
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,370
谢谢  请问您是里夫京德先生吗
Thank you. And is that Mr. Rif-kind?

601
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,660
里夫金德  没错
Rifkind. Yes.

602
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,530
我是西蒙  他的儿子
I'm Simon. I'm his son.

603
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,780
好的  西蒙
Okay, Simon.

604
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,830
你现在在车旁吗
And are you with the car right now?

605
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,200
喂  西蒙
Hello, Simon?

606
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,910
是的
Yes.

607
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,330
是的  我就在车旁
Yes, I'm right by the car.

608
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,530
好的  我们在GPS上找到你了
Okay, we have you on the GPS

609
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,370
所以我们知道你的具体位置
so we know exactly where you are and we'll be with you

610
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,910
大概10到45分钟我们会到现场  好吗
somewhere between 10 and 45 minutes, okay?

611
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,620
请尽快赶过来
Please come as quickly as you can.

612
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,830
谢谢  里夫京德先生  再见
Thank you, Mr. Rif-kind. Goodbye.

613
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,200
里夫金德
Rifkind!

614
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,410
我到底做了什么  我到底做了什么
What have I done? What have I done?

615
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,620
喂
Hello?

616
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,950
天啊  抱歉
God, I'm... I'm so sorry.

617
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,790
-留下  -我操
- Stay! - Fuck that!

618
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,200
我们身边有看不见的超自然力量
The supernatural are unseen forces that surround us.

619
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,700
查尔斯  我现在已经彻底
Charles, I've now investigated

620
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,870
调查了你的两个案子
two of your cases quite thoroughly.

621
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,200
我觉得非常简单
It feels quite simple to me, really.

622
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,660
大脑只看到它想看到的
The brain sees what it wants to see.

623
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,870
这些是你说过的话  查尔斯
They're your words, Charles.

624
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,490
托尼·马修斯是个酒鬼
Tony Matthews is an alcoholic

625
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,330
他还没有从痛苦中走过来
who's wrestling with unresolved grief.

626
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,700
西蒙是个弱不禁风的孩子
And Simon is a fragile young man

627
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,700
来自一个非常不健全的家庭
and from a deeply dysfunctional family

628
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,200
他正处于精神病的边缘
who's on the edge of psychosis.

629
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,990
我已经彻底搞懂了这一切  查尔斯
I understand all too well, Charles

630
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,410
人们很容易困惑
how easy it is to get confused

631
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:14,660
并对自己的判断失去信心
and to lose faith in one's own judgment.

632
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,450
特别是我们疲劳和情绪化...
Especially when we're tired and emotional...

633
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,580
...还有不适的时候
...and unwell.

634
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,080
怎么...
What the...

635
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:53,080
{\an8}第三个案子  麦克·普里德尔

636
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:58,700
跟上  古德曼
Keep up, Goodman.

637
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,490
你相信吗  我是个伤感的人
Thing is, I'm the soppy one if you can believe that.

638
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,450
我们刚在一起的时候  我就想要孩子
I wanted kids from the moment we got together

639
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,120
但玛利亚说  "不  不行  宝贝"
but Maria said, "No, it's not gonna happen, babe."

640
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,120
玛利亚是你的妻子吗
Maria is your wife, yeah?

641
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,280
当然
Yeah, of course, she is.

642
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,660
你知道她为什么不想要孩子吗
Do you know why she didn't want children?

643
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,990
也许你们的经济条件不允许
Presumably, you were comfortable financially.

644
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,620
天啊
Oh, Jesus.

645
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,530
你们这种人这辈子就在想钱吗
That's all your lot ever think about, isn't it? Money.

646
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,580
抱歉  你说的我们这种人是什么意思
Sorry, what exactly do you mean by your lot?

647
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,740
她不会给我生孩子
No way was she getting pregnant

648
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,700
除非让她做公司合伙人
until she was made a partner at the firm.

649
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,330
她说的  不是我说的
Her words, not mine.

650
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,780
头等大事
Priorities.

651
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,870
得有人去赚钱
Someone's got to earn the money

652
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,660
你才能整天无所事事
so you brainy poofters can sit around

653
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,410
一坐就是一整天
stroking your chins and pulling onion

654
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,780
什么都不用担心
out of your arses all day long.

655
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:32,280
等一下
Oh, hang on.

656
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:34,160
我得回一下
Yeah, I've got to do this.

657
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,120
好的
Right.

658
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,580
好吧
Alright.

659
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,490
我们能谈谈那次事件吗
Can we, please, talk about the incident?

660
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,200
你知道在生意上他们叫我什么吗
Do you know what they used to call me when I was trading?

661
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,370
-不知道  -预言家
- No. - The prophet.

662
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,910
我有第六感  知道什么会涨
I had a sixth sense of what was going up

663
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,830
什么会跌
and what was coming down.

664
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,620
这跟金融市场无关
This isn't about the financial markets.

665
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,660
我知道你要问什么
I know what it is you're asking about.

666
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,790
我知道
I know.

667
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,000
跟我去那上面
Come on then, up there.

668
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,910
我在城里赚了一笔
I made a killing in the city.

669
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:27,080
我建了一栋房子  投资房
Uh, I built the house. Real investment property.

670
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,830
那次事件就发生在那栋房子里吗
And that's where the incident happened, at the house?

671
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,450
玛利亚最后变成了合伙人
When Maria finally got partnership

672
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,950
生孩子的时候终于到了
bingo, time to have a baby.

673
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,660
但我们准备要的时候  她已经快40了
But she was pushing 40 when we started though.

674
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,870
她拖得太迟了
So, yeah, she had left it too late.

675
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:44,200
她比戈壁滩还干涸
She was drier than the Gobi Desert down there.

676
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,700
我还是让她别担心
Still, I said not to worry.

677
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,330
试管婴儿
A splash of IVF

678
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,280
可以让我们有一个孩子
get the old baby machine working again.

679
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,160
我有个同学是这个领域的顶尖人物
I'd been to school with the top guy in that field.

680
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,830
花了三万美金后  成功了
So, uh, yeah, 30 grand later, bull's eye.

681
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,740
老姑娘终于怀上了
The old girl is finally up the duff.

682
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,620
为什么总是最后一把钥匙才能打开一切
Oh, why is it always the last key that unlocks everything?

683
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,740
看
Et voila.

684
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,830
一切进展顺利
So, yeah, everything was going great

685
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,160
七个月后
and then seven months in

686
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,740
她突然身体不适
she suddenly started spotting.

687
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,780
我们送她去医院住了几天
So we pop her into a clinic for a couple of days.

688
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,700
花钱进行最好的治疗
Best care money can buy.

689
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,240
简直就跟住豪华酒店一样
It was more like the bloody Savoy!

690
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,740
所以我丢下了她
So I dropped her off.

691
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,080
回到家准备文件
Popped home to do some paperwork.

692
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,160
那时候是几点
Okay, what time was that?

693
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,200
当时是...
It was...

694
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,910
3点45分
Quarter to 4:00, hm.

695
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,950
你真的看到了那一切吗
You're telling me you actually saw that happen?

696
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:33,950
我认为幽灵是一种
It's my understanding that a poltergeist

697
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:36,740
邪恶或气愤的灵魂
is an evil spirit or an angry spirit.

698
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,280
-是真的吗  -不  不是的
- Is that true? - No, it's not.

699
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:41,120
没有任何证据可以支撑这个观点
There's absolutely no evidence to support that.

700
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:45,160
医院的人为玛利亚做了扫描
The guys at the hospital took Maria in for a scan

701
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,200
但他们不想给我们看
but they didn't wanna show us.

702
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,950
他们说扫描结果显示
They said there were distortions

703
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,080
有不正常东西之类的
on the screen or something.

704
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,740
抱歉
Sorry.

705
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,620
我正在处理中国的生意
I'm right in the middle of this Chinese thing.

706
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:03,410
那扫描
Yeah, so the scan...

707
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,530
天啊...
What...

708
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,490
有点吓到了吗  教授
A bit, uh, bit chilly, prof?

709
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,990
抱歉  我...
Sorry, I, uh...

710
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,080
你杀过什么东西吗  古德曼先生
Have you ever killed anything, Mr. Goodman?

711
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,330
当然没有
Certainly not.

712
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,500
反正你不会承认  对吧
Nothing you'll admit to, eh?

713
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,450
医生建议
The doctors thought it best

714
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,450
玛利亚最好在医院再待一晚
that Maria spend another night in the hospital

715
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,240
所以我回到了家里
so I went back to the house.

716
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,000
我有很多工作要做
I had a stack of work to do.

717
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:35,700
在家里应该觉得安全对吧
You're supposed to feel safe in your own home

718
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,040
古德曼先生
aren't you, Mr. Goodman?

719
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,080
你相信鬼怪吗  教授
Do you believe in evil, professor?

720
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,620
我本来不信...
I didn't...

721
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,160
...直到那个晚上
...until that night.

722
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,080
玛利亚
Maria?

723
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,250
玛利亚
Maria?

724
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:04,950
我们死了
We are dead.

725
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,580
你为什么不在医院里
Why aren't you in the hospital?

726
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:28,580
我逃出了房间
I managed to get out of the room.

727
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,720
我不知道我在那里
I don't know how long I'd

728
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,080
站了多久  直到电话响了
been standing there when the phone rang.

729
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,620
是医院打来的
It was the hospital.

730
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:39,080
我知道他们要跟我说什么
I knew what they were going to tell me.

731
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,410
预言家
The prophet.

732
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,500
显然  生产的时候...
Apparently, the birth was..

733
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,120
他把她撕成两半
He split her in two.

734
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,700
我很高兴玛利亚没有活着
I'm glad Maria never lived to see

735
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,330
看到巴蒂的样子
what Barty looked like.

736
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,870
那会要了她的命
That would have destroyed her.

737
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:09,870
没有人相信巴蒂会存活这么久
No one believed that Barty would have survived this long.

738
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:15,660
但不知何故...生命自有奇迹
But somehow life... finds a way.

739
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:17,790
我学到的是
It's what I've learned, that, uh..

740
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,250
...生活还要继续
...life goes on.

741
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,370
什么
What?

742
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:37,080
该死  该死
Fuck. Fuck.

743
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,780
卡梅隆先生  我不知道你在这里
Mr. Cameron, I didn't know you were here.

744
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,200
我知道真相了
I know exactly what's going on.

745
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,160
谢天谢地  真相是什么
Oh, thank God. What?

746
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,660
整件事情都是为了让你重返荧幕的骗局
This whole thing's a stupid, shitty hoax to get you back on TV.

747
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,410
是想抢我位子的方式
It's a way of usurping me.

748
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:19,780
你就是个孤独又嫉妒的老头  这就是真相
You are a lonely, jealous, bitter old man, and that's the truth.

749
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:22,120
古德曼先生  如果你自己遇到那种事
Mr. Goodman, you wouldn't know the truth

750
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,870
你是不会知道真相的
if it kissed you on the lips.

751
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,280
我知道
Well, I know this!

752
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:28,030
这些故事里没有一个
There is nothing in any of these stories

753
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,530
是智力健全的五岁小孩
that couldn't be explained away

754
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,410
不能解释的
by any intelligent five-year-old.

755
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,620
没有
Nothing!

756
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:37,830
你只是无法发现罢了
You just can't find it in yourself.

757
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,000
你能吗  菲利普
Can you, Philip?

758
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:44,990
你无法让自己
You can't find the humility

759
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,280
低头去承认或许  只是或许  
to admit that perhaps, just perhaps

760
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:52,740
事情并非总是表面上看起来那样
things are not always as they seem.

761
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:56,530
这正是我的意思
And that is precisely my point.

762
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:01,580
一切  一切就跟表面上看起来一样
Everything, everything is exactly as it seems.

763
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,740
你确定吗
You sure about that?

764
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,200
当然
Yes.

765
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:47,580
你并非什么都知道
You don't know everything.

766
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,660
是吗  亲爱的
Do you, bubala?

767
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,410
抱歉  能停一下吗
Sorry, can we cut?

768
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,830
你在跟谁讲话
Who are you talking to?

769
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,080
菲利普
Philip...

770
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,830
...大脑只看到...
...the brain sees...

771
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,990
...它想看到的
...what it wants to see.

772
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,830
我真的想给你看点东西
Oh, I really wanna show you something.

773
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,000
可以吗
May I?

774
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,910
进来吧
In you come.

775
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,080
来吧
Come on.

776
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,660
就我们四个人
It will just be the four of us.

777
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:30,120
你  我  巴蒂  还有...
You, me, Barty and, uh..

778
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,500
...你懂的
...you know who.

779
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,950
最后一次机会  古德曼先生
One last chance, Mr. Goodman.

780
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,530
你有什么想告诉我的吗
Anything you want to tell me?

781
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,330
告诉你什么  我...
About what? I'm...

782
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,660
6岁  79岁  还是19岁
6, 79, 19?

783
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:14,810
苦瓜脸的古德曼
Jewface Jewface Goodman

784
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:15,660
婊子养的古德曼
Mommy fucked a dog shit

785
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,990
你当时不在我们学校
Okay, you weren't at school with me.

786
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,750
-你是谁  -你是谁
- Who are you? - Who are you?

787
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,700
鬼精灵  聪明人
Mr. Brain Box, clever clogs

788
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,160
大老板  自己一个人生活
overachiever, living on his own

789
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,700
家里根本没有人
there's no one there at home.

790
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,240
你敢把那种生意场上的敏锐
Dare you turn some of that prize-nominated

791
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:36,040
用到自己身上吗
never-quite-winning acuity onto yourself?

792
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:39,950
11岁  92岁  还是20岁
11, 92, 20?

793
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,330
来吧
Come on. Ahem.

794
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,200
等等  求你了
Wait, wait, please.

795
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,080
我不喜欢这样
I don't like it.

796
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,750
你想进去吗
Do you want to go in?

797
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,870
我不进去
I can't.

798
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:47,830
弄到我衣服上了
That's on my shirt!

799
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,950
你在干什么
What are you doing, man?

800
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,660
苦瓜脸
Oi, Jewface!

801
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,790
苦瓜脸
Oi, Jewface!

802
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,370
来这里
Come here.

803
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,280
-我得回家了  -来这里
- I've got to go home. - Come here.

804
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:05,780
我得回家喝茶了
I've got to go home for my tea.

805
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,780
否则呢  你的茶叶会被老妈吃掉吗
Or what? Your fat pig of a mom will eat it?

806
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,830
我不会再说一次了  伙计
I won't tell you again, mate.

807
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:13,750
来这里
Get here.

808
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,540
快点
Come on.

809
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:20,240
我不会再进去了  弗瑞尔
I'm not going in there again, Freer.

810
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,830
我不会再进去了  弗瑞尔
I'm not going in there again, Freer.

811
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,830
不要吓唬你自己  这不是毒气室
Oh, don't shit yourself. It is not a gas chamber.

812
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,330
站到那里去
Stand over there.

813
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,910
快点
Go on.

814
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,370
太棒了
Yes!

815
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,830
-捡一个起来  -我不想捡
- Alright, pick one up. - I don't wanna.

816
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,330
我他妈才不管你想不想
I don't give a shit what you want.

817
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,490
捡起来
Pick it up!

818
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,540
快点
Go on.

819
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,580
放到你面前
Put it in front of your face.

820
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:05,950
-什么  -放到你面前
- What? - In front of your face!

821
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,160
现在别他妈动了
Now don't you fucking move.

822
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,700
你们在玩什么
What are you playing?

823
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,830
这里怎么回事
What is going on here?

824
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:26,370
侦探酷杰克  来这里  伙计
Hey, Kojak! Hey, come here, mate.

825
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,410

Oh, my God.

826
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:31,620
来吧  伙计  快点
Come on, mate, quick.

827
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,030
酷杰克
Hey, Kojak.

828
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,160
-想跟我们一起吗  -我可以吗
- Wanna be in our gang? - Can I?

829
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,330
你当然可以  伙计  如果你胆子够大
Yeah, of course, you can, mate, if you're cool enough.

830
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:38,370
你觉得你胆子够大吗
Do you think you're cool enough?

831
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,450
你想去哪里  苦瓜脸
Where do you think you're going, Jewface?

832
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:44,080
-我得回家了  -不  别胡说
- I need to get home. - No, bollocks.

833
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,280
你要留在这里
You're staying here.

834
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,780
你要看酷杰克找到第十个数字
You're gonna watch Kojak do the 10th number.

835
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,030
对  留下来看看
Yeah, stay and watch.

836
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,950
让他走吧  弗瑞尔  你知道他不会数数
Leave him alone, Freer. You know he can't count.

837
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,660
我会的  我能数到一百
Yeah, I can. I can count to 100.

838
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,740
听见没有
See?

839
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,490
好吧  来这里  来这里
Right, come here. Come here.

840
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,280
你看回声洞的墙上
You see that on the side of the Echo?

841
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,950
-那是几  -六
- What number is it? - Six.

842
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,990
没错  非常棒  非常棒
Yeah. Well done. Well done.

843
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,240
那是我用粉笔在那里的墙上写的
That's the first number of 10 different numbers

844
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,530
十个不同数字的第一个
I've chalked up on the walls in there.

845
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,450
你如果想加入我们   只需要
All you have to do to be in our gang

846
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:14,120
进到洞里  一直向前走
is go in, right the way in, keep walking

847
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,120
直到你找到所有的十个数字
until you find all 10 of the numbers

848
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,910
然后记住第十个数字
and then remember which is the 10th one, yeah?

849
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:22,240
-卡拉翰  里面没有...  -伙计
- Callahan, there aren't... - Mate!

850
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,950
我只要记住第十个数字吗
I just need to remember the 10th one?

851
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:25,990
没错  你只需要记住第十个数字
Yeah, you only need to remember the 10th one.

852
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,330
你得仔细看  因为有些数字
Now you've got to look carefully 'cause some of them

853
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,530
相隔很远  明白吗
are quite far apart. Yeah?

854
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,120
闭嘴
Shut up!

855
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,830
你出来后  告诉我们第十个数字是什么
Now when you come out and tell me what that 10th number is

856
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:36,830
如果你说得正确  就可以加入我们了
if you tell me the correct number, you can be in our gang.

857
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,830
-明白吗  -我现在就开始
- Yeah? - I'll start now.

858
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:43,830
等一下  你需要这个
Now hang on. You're gonna need this.

859
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:46,370
里面很黑
It gets quite dark in there.

860
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,950
好吧  去找第十个数字吧
Alright. Go get that 10th number then.

861
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,450
去吧
Go on.

862
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:03,790
去吧
Go on.

863
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,030
六
Six.

864
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,030
不错的开始
Good start.

865
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,040
79.

866
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,000
19.

867
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,240
-你想跟他说什么  -没什么
- What were you gonna say to him? - Nothing.

868
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,120
你想告诉他没有第十个数字  不是吗
You were gonna tell him there's no 10th number, weren't you?

869
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,370
不  我没有
No, I wasn't.

870
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,450
你肯定不会告诉他
I bet you weren't gonna tell him

871
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:47,870
你去找的时候吓尿了
you shit yourself when you tried it.

872
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,080
给我闭嘴  不然...
So keep it zipped or else..

873
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,830
明白吗
Alright?

874
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:53,120
20.

875
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,700
48.

876
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,700
我不喜欢这样  我想出去了
I don't like it. I wanna come out now.

877
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,750
不要放弃
Oh, don't give up now.

878
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:08,910
求你了
Please!

879
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:10,500
继续
Oh, keep goin'.

880
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,410
我想出去  真的太窄了
I wanna come out. It's really narrow.

881
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,410
你敢出来试试  酷杰克
Don't you fucking dare, Kojak!

882
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,780
你不找到第十个数字
We're not letting you out of there

883
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:23,910
我们是不会让你出来的
until you find that 10th number, alright?

884
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,040
卡拉翰
Callahan!

885
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,200
卡拉翰
Callahan!

886
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,490
你让他在里面等死了  是吗
You left him to die in there, didn't you?

887
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,660
我能怎么办
What could I have done?

888
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:51,620
回家告诉别人
Told someone when you got home?

889
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,580
第二天开会的时候提起来
Brought it up in assembly the next day?

890
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,830
跑进回声洞看看德斯蒙德
How about running into the Echo

891
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:56,120
是否需要帮助怎么样
to see if Desmond needed help?

892
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,120
那是个意外  只是个意外
It was a fluke, just one of those things.

893
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,080
-一次可怕的意外  -你倒说得轻松
- A horrible accident. - How convenient for you.

894
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,410
我们不知道他有哮喘
We didn't know he was asthmatic.

895
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,780
唯一的意外是他骨子里
The only fluke here is the fluke in his DNA

896
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,370
就容易被你这样的人欺负
that left him vulnerable to people like you.

897
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:09,160
我这样的人
People like me?

898
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,160
我一生都在帮助别人
I've spent my life trying to help people

899
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,530
试图让人们重回正轨
tryin' to put back in

900
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,580
试图让人们看到真相
tryin' to help people see the truth

901
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,450
让人们看清那些谎言和扯淡
in amongst the sea of sentimental lies and crap.

902
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:21,740
那...
That's...

903
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:24,200
不要嘲笑我
Don't laugh at me!

904
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,660
不是我让他进去的
I wasn't the one who made him go in there.

905
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:31,450
不是我叫他酷杰克的
I wasn't the one who called him Kojak to his face

906
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:34,200
不是我在他想出来的时候
and I wasn't the one who wouldn't let him come out

907
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,410
不让他出来  我什么都没做
when he wanted to. I did nothing.

908
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,660
没错  你什么都没做
That's right. You did nothing.

909
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,830
你只是路过
You passenger.

910
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:44,450
从那之后  你过得怎么样  古德曼先生
And since then how have you spent your days, Mr. Goodman?

911
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:47,200
把生命最大的问题简化到原子和分子的程度
Reducing life's biggest questions to atoms and molecules?

912
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,580
本来就只是原子和分子
It is just atoms and molecules.

913
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,120
否则还能有什么
What else is there, for God's sake?

914
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,080
你好  我来了
Hello, here I come.

915
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,790
我来了
Here I come.

916
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,620
巴蒂  没事了
Barty, shh, it's okay.

917
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,330
看  看  看
Look, look, look.

918
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,950
看  没事了  爸爸带了吃的
Look, it's alright. Daddy's got meow-meow.

919
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,040
没事了
It's alright.

920
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:18,700
我们来吃一大口
Here we go, a big one.

921
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,580
嘴巴张大点  好的
Open wide. Open wide. Yeah.

922
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:24,660
好  好孩子
Yes. Good boy.

923
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,950
好孩子
Good boy.

924
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,250
好孩子
Good boy.

925
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:35,280
好孩子  巴蒂
Good boy, Barty.

926
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:37,330
好孩子
Oh, there's a good boy.

927
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,620
古德曼先生
Mr. Goodman,

928
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,080
你说得很轻松
for all your clever talk

929
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,700
但你其实比其他人更害怕  对不对
you're really more scared than anyone, aren't you?

930
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,100
你这一生
And what you've actually

931
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,780
在做的事  不是帮助别人
been doing with your life isn't helping others

932
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:56,030
而是逃避你最大的恐惧
it's running from your greatest fear

933
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,410
而且你此时此刻的恐惧最大
which is that there's more than the here and now

934
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:01,240
你知道你过去所有做过的事
and that every action you've ever taken

935
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:04,000
或者没做的事  都有一定后果
or didn't take has had an effect.

936
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,580
一切都会留下痕迹
It's left a little trace.

937
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,120
那就是鬼
A ghost of itself.

938
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,500
没错吧
That's true, isn't it?

939
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:17,580
嘘
Shh.

940
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,990
嘘
Shh.

941
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,290
他睡着了
He's asleep.

942
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:28,280
-嘘  -嘘
- Shh. - Shh.

943
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:29,450
来吧
Come on.

944
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,740
嘘
Shh.

945
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,910
求你了
Please.

946
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:58,500
卡拉翰
Callahan.

947
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,370
卡拉翰  真的对不起
Callahan, I'm so sorry!

948
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:12,830
不
Oh, no.

949
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:15,330
不  不要再这样了
Oh, no. Not, not again.

950
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,120
求你了
Please.

951
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:29,500
求你了  求你了  求你了
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

952
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:34,780
卡拉翰  求你了  求你了
Callahan, please, please, please.

953
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:36,450
对不起  真的对不起
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

954
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:39,250
求你了
Please.

955
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:45,500
卡拉翰  卡拉翰
Callahan. Callahan.

956
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:05,830
...突然生气了
...and just went mad.

957
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:07,580
她说"你就是这样子"
"That's typical of you," She said.

958
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,620
"马克大人  只想着你自己"
"Lord Muck, always thinking of himself."

959
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:13,160
我知道上周五晚上我没去  妈妈
Yes, I know I missed last Friday night, mom.

960
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,700
抱歉  你可以告诉爸爸
I'm sorry. Um, well, you could tell dad

961
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:19,080
这周五我会去  好吗
that I will be there this Friday, okay?

962
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,200
拜托  妈妈  我在上班
Please, mom, I'm at work.

963
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,540
得挂了
I've gotta go.

964
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,620
我也爱你  拜拜
Love you too. Bye.

965
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,330
普里德尔先生
Mr. Priddle.

966
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,490
对  菲利普·古德曼教授
Ah, yes. "Professor Philip Goodman

967
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,830
4月13日凌晨三点三刻入院
"Admitted April 13, 3:45 a.m.

968
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:41,370
自杀未遂
attempted suicide."

969
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:44,910
想在车里窒息自杀未成功
"Failed self-asphyxiation in his car."

970
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:47,200
蠢家伙
Silly bugger.

971
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,740
想自杀直接一枪崩了自己啊
Shotgun in the mouth, that's the way to do it!

972
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,540
这个得看
Oh, better see this.

973
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:03,870
好了
Right.

974
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:09,780
神经检查显示
Neurological examination reveals

975
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:12,580
瞳孔固定且放大
fixed and dilated pupils.

976
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:15,780
最后诊断结果是什么  里夫京德
So what's our verdict, Dr. Rif-kind?

977
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:18,160
是里夫金德...
Rifkind, uh..

978
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,870
是...昏迷
It, uh, coma.

979
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,830
可能是闭锁综合症
Uh, probable lock-in.

980
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,280
他要永远留在这里了
He is here for keeps.

981
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:24,660
对  就像那种...
Yeah, just one of those things.

982
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,450
灯亮着  却没人在家
Lights are on, there's nobody home.

983
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:32,990
正如我的教授老师查理·卡梅隆说的
