1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,336
宇宙守护神  保护我们远离邪恶
Guardian of the universe protecting us against the forces of evil.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,712
他能徒手抓住子弹  拦住疾速的火车
He can catch a bullet. halt a speeding train.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,181
轻轻一跳就能飞跃高楼
And leap tall buildings in a single bound.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,550
-在天上  -是鸟  还是飞机
- up in the sky! - is it a bird? is it a plane?

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,687
白天只是一名邮差  晚上却化身超级英雄
A mailman by day. the city's guardian by night.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,656
保卫纽约市民免受邪恶滋扰
Defending the citizens of New York from the forces of evil.

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,860
一群超乎常人的英雄们
The world has been protected by a group of extraordinary men and women...

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,129
致力于与犯罪作斗争  保护这个世界
...who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime.

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,131
另一个世界的神秘来客
Mysterious traveller from another dimension.

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,568
他的力量远远超出了人类
He has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere earthlings.

11
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,872
我总是奇怪  为什么在我之前没人尝试过
I always wondered why nobody did it before me.

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,114
想想看  在那些漫画  电影  电视剧里
I mean, all those comic books, movies, tvshows.

13
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,383
你以为只有真正怪癖宅人才会给自己做一身超人装
You'd think that one eccentric loner would have made himself a costume.

14
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,061
我是说  日常生活真这么激动人心吗  
I mean, is everyday life really so exciting?

15
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,266
学校和公司生活真这么惊心动魄
Are schools and offices so thrilling...

16
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,064
以至于只有我才去幻想这些吗
...that I'm the only one who ever fantasized about this?

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,834
得了吧  坦白说
Come on, be honest with yourself.

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,365
每个人心中  都想成为一个超级英雄
At some point in our lives we all wanted to be a superhero.

19
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,420
顺便  这可不是我
That's not me, by the way.

20
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,462
而是某个有精神病的亚美尼亚人
That's some Armenian guy with a history of mental health problems.

21
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,525
我是何人
Who am I?

22
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,930
我是"海扁王"
I'm Kick-Ass.

23
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,930
六个月前

24
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,673
这才是我  当时这些破事还没发生
That's me... back before any of this crazy shit happened.

25
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,077
我大概是那种最不像超级英雄的人了
I guess I was the last person you'd expect to become a superhero.

26
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,086
不是说我有什么不正常
I'm not saying there was anything wrong with me...

27
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,251
而是再正常不过了
...but there's nothing special, either.

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,154
-混球  -我体育不好
- asshole! - I wasn't into sports.

29
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,392
数学不好  也不擅长打游戏
I wasn't a mathlete or a hard core gamer.

30
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:18,302
我身上没穿过环  也没厌食症
I didn't have a piercing or an eating disorder,

31
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:19,966
Space上好友也不多
or 3000 friends on myspace.

32
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,173
我唯一的超能力就是能让女生们忽视我
My only superpower was being invisible to girls.

33
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,238
就算在朋友里  我也不是最会搞笑的
And out of my friends, man, I wasn't even the funny one.

34
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,878
和大多数我的同龄人一样  我再普通不过了
Like most people my age, I just existed.

35
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,196
同学们  早上好
Good morning, class.

36
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,097
请打开书本  翻到第二幕  第二场
Please open your books to act two, scene two.

37
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,269
要是你闯进我卧室  多半会发现我在看电视
Kick in my bedroom door and you'll probably find me watching tv...

38
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,774
要不就是在Skype上跟我朋友陶德聊天
...or talking to my friend todd on skype.

39
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,208
-你看《恶搞之家》吗  -不看
- You watching 'family guy'? - No.

40
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,404
我也不看  去看巨乳网  很赞的
Me neither. turn on nippleslip. com. it's good.

41
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,848
要不就是在打手枪  通常是意淫我的英文老师
Or jerking off, mostly to my english teacher.

42
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,456
戴夫·莱泽斯基  别以为我没发现你盯着我的胸看
Dave Lizewski. don't think I haven't noticed you looking at my tits.

43
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:20,099
来吧  戴夫  快来爱抚我吧
Oh, I want your hands all over me, Dave. please.

44
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,304
当然  平凡无奇的学校日子
Sure, a lot of what got me through the average school day...

45
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,705
只有靠打打灰机来打发
...was making deposits in the whac koff warehouse for later.

46
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,641
但说实话  我的兴奋点比较低
Though, to be honest, it didn't take much to set me off.

47
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,682
我发誓  一旦我的荷尔蒙恢复正常
I swear, when my hormones balance out...

48
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,412
就用不着耗费这么多纸巾了  伙计
...shares in kleenex are gonna take a dive, man.

49
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,954
戴夫·莱泽斯基  专心看你的《哈姆雷特》
Dave Lizewski. shouldn't you be looking at 'Hamlet' right now?

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,526
好的  赞恩女士
Yes, mrs Zane.

51
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,822
抱歉
Sorry.

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,733
别误会  我也喜欢同龄女生
But don't get me wrong. I like girls my own age, too.

53
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,528
-特别是凯蒂·多玛  -你好  美人儿
- Especially Katie Deauxma. - Hey, gorgeous.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,332
你好
Hey.

55
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,438
哦不
Oh... no.

56
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,238
你是指艾丽卡吧
You meant Erika.

57
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,048
我知道  我只是在开玩笑
I know. I knew that. I was just kidding.

58
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,415
好吧  不好笑
Okay, cool.

59
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,282
我的天
Oh my god.

60
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,395
看  这是陶德的老妈
Hey, look, I'm Todd's mom.

61
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,066
真好笑  这是你老爸
That's funny. this is your dad.

62
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,535
不  那还是我妈
No, that's still my mom, actually.

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,304
我操
Oh, the fuck!

64
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,743
我只是个普通人
I was just a regular guy.

65
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:41,848
没被蜘蛛咬过  也不是流亡地球的外星人[蜘蛛侠和超人]
No radioactive spiders, no refugee status from a doomed alien world.

66
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,984
陶德说"巧古拉伯爵"[一种麦片]还没停产
You know what? Todd said they do still make count Chocula.

67
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,077
只是超市里不卖了而已
They just don't sell it at the store any more.

68
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,153
我老妈得了动脉瘤  死在了厨房里
My mother was killed by an aneurism in the kitchen.

69
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,694
而不是在小巷子里被人枪杀[蝙蝠侠]
As opposed to a gunman in the alley.

70
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,895
所以要是你指望有以下的桥段
So if you were hoping for any...

71
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,198
我会为你报仇  母亲大人
I will avenge you, mother!

72
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,667
你会失望的
...you're out of luck.

73
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,835
我妈去世十八个月之后
In the 18 months since my mother died...

74
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,532
我唯一的顿悟就是  生活还得继续
...the only epiphany I had was realising that life just goes on.

75
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,834
包装上的蜜蜂形象变了吗
Did they change the bee's face?

76
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,968
没有
No.

77
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,854
怎么从来没人试着做个超级英雄
How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?

78
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,124
我不知道  大概是因为根本不可能吧  笨蛋
Boy, I dunno. probably because it's fucking impossible, dipshit.

79
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,328
戴上面具  助人为乐  这有什么不可能
What, putting on a mask and helping people, how's that impossible?

80
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,962
那又不算是超级英雄
That's not superhero, though.

81
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,231
所谓超级  就要上天入地  比其他人都强
Super's like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit.

82
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:34,233
你那最多只是英雄
That's just hero.

83
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,430
不  连英雄都不算  只能算是疯子
No, it's not even hero. it's just fucking psycho.

84
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,807
那蝙蝠侠呢  他又没超能力
Hello? Bruce Wayne? he didn't have any powers.

85
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,242
对  但他有一身根本造不出来的牛逼装备
Yes, but he had all the expensive shit that doesn't exist.

86
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,545
你是问现实生活  现实生活中没有这套
I thought you meant how come nobody does it in real life?

87
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,180
没错  陶德  我就是这个意思
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

88
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,682
老兄  要是现实生活中真有人这么做  不被海扁才怪
Dude, if anybody did it in real life they'd get their ass kicked.

89
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,784
-估计撑不过一天就挂了  -没错
- They'd be dead in, like, a day. - A day.

90
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,686
好吧  我不是说要有人这么做
Yeah, okay, I'm not saying they should do it.

91
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,984
我只是很费解  为什么没人尝试
I just can't figure out why nobody does.

92
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,659
说真的  有那么多人喜欢超级英雄
Seriously, out of all the millions of people who love superheroes,

93
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,923
难道就没人想去尝试吗
You'd think one would give it a try.

94
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,997
天啊  难道你们不困惑吗
Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?

95
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,522
为什么成千上万的人挖空心思
Why thousands of people wanna be Paris

96
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,167
想成为帕丽斯·希尔顿  却没人想当蜘蛛侠
Hilton and nobody wants to be spiderman?

97
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,170
对呀  为啥呢  她的胸那么小  跟没有一样
Yeah, what's with that? she has, like, no tits at all.

98
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,706
估计是因为她的性爱自拍吧  蜘蛛侠没拍过
Maybe it's a porn tape. he doesn't have a porn tape.

99
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,731
你们难道没看过《与蜘蛛侠的一夜风流》[A片]
You guys never saw 'One Night in Spiderman'?

100
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,509
猜猜谁来了
Oooh, guess who?

101
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,008
你们谁跟我一样  觉得克里斯·达米科很可怜
Is it me or do you kinda feel sorry for chris D'Amico?

102
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,056
老爸那么有钱  永远要啥有啥  真是糟透了
Must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want.

103
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,575
真希望你啥都没说
I wish you wouldn't have said anything

104
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:33,253
我都要哭出来了
Cos I feel like I'm gonna start crying...

105
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,721
事实上  他总是独来独往
The fact that he's always on his own.

106
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,600
我们应该跟他聊聊
We should, like, talk to him.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,235
看看他愿不愿意跟我们一块玩
See if he wants to hang out with us.

108
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,036
我不是说就去搭个讪而已
Oh, I didn't say we should talk to him, I just...

109
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,605
想想看  有他这样的朋友该多牛逼
Think about it. come on, it'd be awesome.

110
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,631
看谁还敢来找我们的麻烦
If he was our friend, no one would ever fuck with us again.

111
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,742
那你去吧  陶德
Go on then, Todd.

112
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,110
-你想和他聊聊吗  -不不不
- You wanna go talk to him? - No, no, no. no.

113
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,278
为什么  你想和他聊  我可以让个位置
No, you wanna go talk to him? I can move.

114
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,838
-应该让戴夫去  -对  应该让戴夫去
- Dave, Dave should go. - Dave should go.

115
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,409
-为什么  -戴夫  是该让你去
- Why? - Dave, you should totally go.

116
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,218
-损友  -不要怕  戴夫
- You're a dick. - Don't be afraid, dave.

117
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,480
你们真怂
You're a pussy.

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,359
滚开
Fuck off!

119
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,798
-你刚才是不是吓死了  -我都快尿裤子了
- Did you spray anything over there? - I think I might have shat my pants.

120
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,944
要是换了我  肯定海扁他一顿
If that guy spoke to me like that I would have kicked his ass.

121
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,013
算了吧  你什么时候跟人动过手
Todd, when have you ever kicked anyone's ass?

122
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,413
不管怎样  我可以偷袭他膝盖
Whatever, man. I would have just gone for his knees.

123
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,817
你说得没道理
Well, you're not making sense.

124
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,186
我是说蝙蝠镖的强大威力
Well, what I'm saying is the superior force of batman's batarang

125
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,221
肯定能穿透小丑的动力场
would undoubtedly penetrate the joker's force field,

126
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,656
这样他就完全无力抵抗...
Leaving him totally vulnerable to the...

127
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,750
-好吧  但是...  -那俩娘娘腔又来了
- All right, and then... but, you know... - Whoa, whoa, whoa pussy patrol.

128
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,360
手机  钱  交出来
Phones. Money.

129
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,089
不是吧  大哥  又来
Dude, not again, come on.

130
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:45,865
还有手机
Phone.

131
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,095
我没手机  上星期被人抢了
I don't have one someone else jacked it last week.

132
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,703
-废物  -袋子给我
- Pussy. - Give me the bag.

133
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,866
-里面都是漫画书  -少废话  想挨刀子吗
- It's just comics. - Yo, you wanna get cut?

134
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,980
你瞧这混蛋  就那么干看着
Look at this asshole just watching.

135
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,120
得了吧  说实话
Come on, be honest with yourself.

136
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,992
要是你  你又能怎样
Would you do anything differently?

137
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,858
当你看见别人陷于危难  你想要伸出援手
We see someone in trouble and we wish we could help,

138
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,262
可你就是做不到
But we don't.

139
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,968
在我生活的这个世界  英雄只存在于漫画里
The world I lived in... heroes only existed in comic books.

140
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:32,968
加入购物车

141
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:37,512
要是坏蛋也一样  那其实也没什么
I guess that would have been okay if bad guys were make-believe, too.

142
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,949
可是坏蛋不一样
But they're not.

143
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:41,020
弗兰克木料仓库

144
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,353
阿弗  我发誓我没胡编
Frankie, I'm telling you, man, I swear I'm not making this up.

145
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,627
那个王八蛋  不知道从哪儿冒出来
This fucking guy comes out of nowhere.

146
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,222
海扁了我们一顿  把可卡因都抢光了
Kicks our asses and steals all the coke.

147
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,001
-那家伙像蝙蝠侠吗  -我什么时候说蝙蝠侠了
- The guy that looks like batman? - I didn't say he looked like batman.

148
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,970
你说了  崔  你说那家伙像蝙蝠侠
You did Tre, you said the guy looked like batman.

149
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,039
-他说对方带了面具啥的  -还有斗篷
- He said like a mask and stuff. - And a cape.

150
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
那就是蝙蝠侠嘛
Yeah, like batman.

151
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,943
我没说像蝙蝠侠  我压根没提过蝙蝠侠
I didn't say "like batman". I never said "batman".

152
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,069
好吧
Okay.

153
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,638
我来告诉你问题出在哪  崔
Let me tell you the problem I got with that, Tre.

154
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:13,211
我们在俄国佬那边的卧底说法有点不一样
Our mole with the Russians tells things a little different.

155
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,324
据他所说  是你卖了我的毒品还私吞了这笔钱
According to him, you sold him my coke and you took the money.

156
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,451
那是他妈的胡扯
That's a fucking lie!

157
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:24,464
难以置信  你居然相信俄国佬胡扯的屁话
I can't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking Russian,

158
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:24,797
伙计
Man!

159
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,561
崔  咱倒是分析下  哪种说法更可信
Let me see, Tre, what's more likely, huh?

160
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,870
要么是你这个利欲熏心的小王八蛋
That you're a greedy little

161
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,339
要么是超人大驾光临抢走了我的毒品
Cock-sucker or all my coke was stolen by superman?

162
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,074
-是蝙蝠侠  -我没说是蝙蝠侠
- Batman. - I never said batman!

163
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,371
够了
Enough!

164
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,881
我儿子还在等我带他去看电影  我不想扫他兴
My son is waiting to go to the movies and I ain't gonna disappoint him.

165
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,518
乔  这事你看着办
Joe, you're in charge.

166
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,755
这是我这辈子听过最烂的借口  崔
That's gotta be the worst fucking excuse I ever heard, Tre.

167
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,368
-抱歉让你久等了  儿子  -电影再过十分钟就要开场了
- Sorry you had to wait, buddy. - the movie is starting in 10 minutes.

168
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,131
这有什么
It's okay, we're cool.

169
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,820
大不了错过预告片
We're only gonna miss the trailers.

170
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,535
对  可是我还想买点爆米花
Yeah, but I wanna get some popcorn.

171
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,666
到了之后给克里斯买点爆米花  知道吗
When we get in there, get chris some popcorn. okay?

172
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,645
想喝点什么
What d'you wanna drink?

173
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,180
-百事可乐吗  -行
- You want a pepsi? - Yeah, that's fine.

174
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,343
给他买罐百事可乐  我来杯思乐冰  混合口味的
Get him a pepsi and I'll have an icee. mixed.

175
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,776
就是那种红加蓝的[樱桃加蓝莓]
Like when they mix the red one and the blue one.

176
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,986
再来包扭扭糖
And a pack of twizzlers.

177
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,841
漫画书里说得不对
The comic books had it wrong.

178
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,775
想成为超级英雄并不需要经历创伤
It didn't take a trauma or cosmic

179
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,610
宇宙射线或者能量戒指
rays or a power ring to make a superhero.

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,756
只需要一点点乐观  再加一点点天真
Just the perfect combination of optimism and naivety.

181
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,421
你帅毙了
You are fucking awesome.

182
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,931
来吧  放马过来
Come on then, bring it on!

183
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,931
与此同时

184
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,285
-爸爸  我害怕  -来吧  敏蒂  宝贝儿
- Daddy, I'm scared. - come on, mindy. honey.

185
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,490
你都这么大了  没什么好怕的
Be a big girl now. there's nothing to be afraid of.

186
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,533
-会很痛吗  -孩子
- Is it gonna hurt bad? - Oh, child.

187
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,499
一下子就好了  小宝贝
Only for a second, sugar.

188
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,874
手枪子弹的速度会超过
A handgun bullet travels at more than...

189
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,410
-每小时七百码  -对
- 700 miles an hour. - 700 miles an hour.

190
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,963
所以在这样的距离
So at close range, like this,

191
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:29,014
冲力肯定会让你腾空而起
The force is gonna take you off your feet for sure...

192
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,040
但是不会比当胸一拳更疼
...but it's really no more painful than a punch in the chest.

193
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,051
我讨厌被当胸一拳
I hate getting punched in the chest.

194
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,516
你会没事的  小宝贝
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

195
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,223
感觉如何  也不是很疼吧
How was that? not so bad.

196
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,664
挺好玩的吧  现在你知道这种感觉了
Kinda fun, huh? now you know how it feels.

197
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,173
下回你再见到有人掏出一把格洛克  就不会害怕了
You won't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a glock.

198
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,143
-我什么时候怕过  -这才是我的宝贝女儿
- I wouldn't have been scared anyways. - That's my girl.

199
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,978
好了  起来吧
All right, up you get. come on.

200
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,580
再来两回  我们就回家
Two more rounds and then home.

201
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,480
-还来啊  -对啊
- Again? - Uh-huh.

202
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,849
那回去的时候得带我去保龄球馆
Only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back.

203
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,513
-保龄球馆  -对  然后再来点冰淇淋
- The bowling alley? - Yeah. and ice-cream after.

204
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,589
行  再来两轮  不准躲不准叫
Okay. two more rounds. no wincing...

205
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,600
咱们就成交  小家伙
...no whining, and you got yourself a deal, young lady.

206
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,370
我要份奶油巧克力圣代
Yeah! I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.

207
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,361
好品位  宝贝儿
Good call, baby doll.

208
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,634
你还想要点什么生日礼物
So, have you thought about what you might want for your birthday?

209
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,474
我能要只小狗吗
Can I get a puppy?

210
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,079
-你想要只狗吗  -对  毛茸茸的那种
- You wanna get a dog? - Yeah, a cuddly fluffy one.

211
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,916
再要个影星版的街头美少女莎雪娃娃
And a bratz moviestar makeover sasha.

212
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,728
我耍你的  老爸
I'm just fucking with you, daddy.

213
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,095
我想要把蝴蝶牌的四十二型蝴蝶刀
Look, I'll have a benchmade model-42 butterfly knife.

214
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,926
宝贝儿  你总是吓我一跳
Oh, child. you always knock me for a loop.

215
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,537
-你猜怎着  -怎么
- You know what? - What?

216
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,639
-我给你买两把  -真的
- I'm gonna get you two. - Two?

217
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,904
两把蝴蝶刀  全都给你
One balisong. two balisong. that's what you get.

218
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,464
[出自哈姆雷特]风流的宝镜  人伦的雅范
The glass of fashion and the mould of form.

219
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,401
-举世注目的中心  -安静
- The observed of all observers, - Quite, quite down!

220
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,131
这样无可挽回地殒落
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched...

221
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,678
说句老实话
I'll be honest,

222
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,205
刚开始那几周我打击罪犯的机会并不多
There wasn't a whole lot of crime-fighting in those first few weeks.

223
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,149
即便如此  我的新生活也够忙的
But even so, my new vocation kept me plenty busy.

224
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,459
见鬼
Shit.

225
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,983
我管这叫预备期
I called it preparation.

226
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,828
但你要说我这是在做白日梦  我也没法反驳
But if you called it fantasizing, it would have been hard to argue.

227
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,636
我只知道  我的自我感觉从没有这么好过
All I knew was I'd never felt so good about myself.

228
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,345
操
Fuck!

229
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,785
好吧  大概我还处于基础调试期
Okay, maybe I was still in the beta testing phase.

230
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,660
但这仅仅是个开始
But it was a start.

231
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,346
你他妈看什么呢
What the fuck are you looking at?

232
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,484
-没什么  -快他妈给我滚
- Nothing. - Get the fuck out of here!

233
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,293
每个连环杀手都明白
Like every serial killer already knew,

234
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,194
总有一天幻想将无法再满足你的需要
Eventually fantasizing just doesn't do it for you any more.

235
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,992
是时候付诸行动了
It was time to engage.

236
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,500
快点  伙计
Hurry up, man.

237
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,433
我操  这搞什么
What the fuck...?

238
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,146
你他妈看什么呢
The fuck you looking at?

239
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,512
我问你  你他妈看什么呢
I said what the fuck are you looking at?

240
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
两个垃圾人渣在撬一辆汽车
Two cheap shit losers screwing with a car...

241
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,159
要知道那可是人家拼死拼活挣来的
...that someone probably worked their ass off to pay for.

242
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,060
-你说啥  -别管他了  伙计
- Say what? - Leave it be, man.

243
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,269
这傻逼肯定是磕多了
This motherfucker's obviously high.

244
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,060
我没嗑药
I'm not high.

245
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,902
我只是觉得你们不能为所欲为
I just think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want.

246
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,710
远离那辆车  我就当这事没发生过
Just walk away from the car and we can forget about this.

247
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,486
你疯了吧  哥们
You're crazy, man.

248
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,676
打死丫的
Fuck this shit.

249
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,359
-操  -快跑
- Shit. - Let's get out of here.

250
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,839
我求了医生半天 
I came round long enough to beg the

251
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,316
让他别跟其他人说我的装扮
Medic not to tell anybody about the costume.

252
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,518
他答应了
He promised he wouldn't.

253
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,380
我只知道我老爸一定会杀了我
All I knew was my dad was gonna kill me.

254
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,109
为什么我没枪  我是保安啊
Why can't I have a gun? I'm a security guard.

255
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,578
你现在就是个看门的  不会再有枪了
You're a doorman now. you don't get a gun no more.

256
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,113
我看起来真衰
I look like a putz.

亲爱的  弗兰克
Frank, honey.

271
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,354
你跟着来干嘛
Where do you think you're going?

272
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,392
爸  我不介意你在我面前谈生意  我可以就这么听着
I don't mind you talking business. I was just gonna sit quietly.

273
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,986
我也该开始学点东西了
I should probably start learning this stuff anyway.

274
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,829
回去吃你的饭
Hey, go finish your oatmeal.

275
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,663
该死  我还有八个月就成年了
God-dammit, I'm gonna be 18 in 8 months, for christ sakes.

276
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,928
坐下来吧
Take a seat.

277
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,309
出什么事了
So what's the problem?

278
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:15,042
俄罗斯佬说崔以半价又卖给他们五公斤
Our Russian says that tre just sold him another 5 k's at half price.

279
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,844

- Which Tre? Tre Tre? - Right. dead Tre.

280
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,553
这么说我他妈地被鬼给阴了一把咯
So now I'm getting fucked in the ass by a ghost?

281
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,418
不然就是崔没说谎
Or tre was telling the truth.

282
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,925
啥  我沦落至此了吗  不是相信鬼就是相信超级英雄
What, this is my choice? I gotta believe in ghosts or superheroes?

283
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,597
不关超级英雄的事  阿弗
Not the part about the superhero, Frankie.

284
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,589
可能只是有人抢了他的货
Just that he might have really been gaffled by somebody.

285
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:42,132
我想是时候  请俄国佬来谈一谈了
I think we better invite our russian over for a friendly chat.

286
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,109

The point is some fucker is killing our guys.

306
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,262

00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,018
我在想怎么告诉你好
I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this.

391
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,390
-最近学校里有流言说  -对
- There's a rumour going around... - Right.

392
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,825
-说你是...  -啥
- ...that you... - What?

393
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,656
-同性恋  -啥?!
- ...are gay. - Gay?!

394
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,930
-怎么会有这种流言  -你被抢劫了
- What kind of rumour's that? - Well, getting mugged and...

395
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,366
-你们都被抢劫过啊  -对  但是...
- You guys have been mugged. - I know, but...

396
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,035
你被狂扁一顿  还被扒光衣服
...we didn't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off.

397
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,061
才不是那样  是医护人员把我的衣服脱掉的
It's not even true. the medic threw my clothes away.

398
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,175
别在意了  只是流言而已
Don't worry about it. rumours don't mean shit.

399
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,042
我们知道你不是的
We know the truth.

400
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:51,643
对吧
Right?

401
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,377
-是啊  -就是嘛
- Yeah. - Yeah.

402
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,746
谁知道呢  搞不好你能把她搞定
Who knows, this might even get you laid.

403
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,909
她如果以为他是基佬就没戏  陶德  你个白痴
No, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd. you fucking retard.

404
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,043
-多谢你泼冷水  小马  -我只是实话实说
- That's really fucking helping me! - I'm just being honest.

405
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,188
我又回到了老样子
I was getting back to my old self.

406
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,459
也许我应该放弃
I should have quit, of course...

407
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,060
但人不能说重来就重来
...but you can't just re-programme yourself...

408
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,765
你是谁  想要什么  人生目标
...what you want, who you are, your purpose in life.

409
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,535
不  我只是路过
No, I'm just standing around.

410
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,096
才不是
No, I'm not!

411
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,037
-就是这样而已  -尝到厉害了吧
- It is what it is. - How about that, huh?

412
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,279
你怕了吧
Oh, yeah. didn't see that, did you?

413
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,215
你最好赶快滚蛋
Think it's best that you just walk away.

414
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,683
你最好别这么干
Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

415
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,651
啥
What? huh?

416
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,585
你看什么看
Are you looking at me?

417
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,212
这事我管定了
Well, this is my business.

418
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:43,212
我是海扁王  打击罪恶的蒙面英雄

419
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,895
我吗  我已经重生
Me? my hardware was fixed now.

420
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,865
海扁王升级版重新登场
I was back and running Kick-Ass version 2.0.

421
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:57,865
寻猫启示  咬咬猫先生

422
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,406
不好意思  你见过这只猫吗
Excuse me. Have you seen this cat?

423
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,880
没有吗  好吧  谢谢
No? okay, thank you.

424
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,346
打搅下  夫人  你见过这只猫吗
Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this cat?

425
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,592
不好意思  你见过这只猫吗
I'm sorry, did you see this cat?

426
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,924
没有吗  好吧
No? okay.

427
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,644
太好了
Oh, great!

428
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,880
猫咪  过来
Here, kitty. here, mr Bitey.

429
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,996
哦不  别这样
Come on. no, no, no, no, no.

430
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,157
不  咬咬猫先生  过来
No, no, no. mr Bitey, come on.

431
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,630
回来  我带你回家
Back here. come on, let's get you home. come on.

432
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,541
滚你的  臭猫
Fuck you, mr Bitey!

433
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,455
天  哥们  不好意思
Oh, god, I'm so sorry, man.

434
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,387
你他妈...
You fucking...

435
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,562
多谢  怪胎
Thanks, freak.

436
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,659
-放开他  -滚开  关你屁事
- Leave him alone. - Fuck off, it's none of your business.

437
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,031
管定了
Yes it is.

438
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,231
快报警
Hey, call 911!

439
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,769
有个穿得像超级英雄的人  在外面跟一群人打起来了
Hey, there's a dude dressed like a superhero fighting a bunch of guys.

440
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,074
真是酷毙了
It's fucking awesome!

441
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,771
放开他
Leave him alone!

442
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,047
放弃吧  赶快滚蛋
Give it up, man. just walk away.

443
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,320
绝不
No, never.

444
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,559
你他妈脑子烧坏了吗  你又不认识他
What the fuck is wrong with you? you'd rather die for some piece of shit..

445
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,026
你愿意为他而死吗
...that you don't even fucking know?

446
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,427
你们当着那么多人三打一
You 3 assholes laying into 1 guy while everybody else watches.

447
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,331
到底是谁脑子有病
And you wanna know what's wrong with me?!

448
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,779
没错  我宁愿死  放马过来
Yeah, I'd rather die. so bring it on!

449
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,879
妈的  你这小子真的疯了
You're fucking crazy, kid.

450
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,525
谢谢
Thank you.

451
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,193
什么
What?!

452
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,522
谢谢你
Thank you.

453
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,436
这真是帅呆了  你是谁
That fucking rocked. who are you?

454
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,868
我是海扁王
I'm Kick-Ass.

455
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,915
老兄  你一定要看看这个
Dude, you gotta check this shit out.

456
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,779
什么东西
What is it?

457
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,785
一小时后
And coming up after the hour.

458
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,188
一位蒙面正义使者红遍各大网站
A costume vigilante has become the latest internet phenomenon...

459
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:08,249
汉密尔顿公园的一位居民  拍下了他的英雄壮举
After a Hamilton park resident filmed the man's remarkable intervention...

460
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,429
-酷毙了  -可不是
- This is awesome. - Fuck, yeah!

461
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,499
欢迎收看纽约特别视点
Welcome to this special edition of eye on New York.

462
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,268
你愿意付出多少代价  去帮助身边的人
How far would you go to help your fellow man?

463
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,571
这位身着异服的人  路见不平对抗黑帮
This colourful individual has been all over the news...

464
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,741
各大新闻已经纷纷报道
...after a video of his intervention of street gang violence...

465
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,369
同时也成为点击率最高的网络视频
...became the most watched clip on the internet.

466
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,141
你们当着那么多人...
You 3 assholes laying into 1 guy...

467
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:34,150
我的Space上只有38个好友
Myspace...38 friends.

468
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,447
而海扁王的Space上已经有一万六千多好友
Kick Ass's myspace...16,000 and counting.

469
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:40,349
实在太疯狂了  我就爱这种感觉
This thing was going crazy and I was loving it.

470
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,995
我们迫切想知道这个人到底是谁
And finally, we want to know who is this man.

471
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,761
谁有任何关于这位潜水服英雄的线索
Does anyone have any idea who this wetsuit crusader is?

472
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,668
他一定就在我们的身边
He must be someone's son, someone's brother,

473
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,003
我们身边的普通人
Someone's next door neighbour.

474
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,233
我的妈呀  怎么回事
Holy shit. what happened?

475
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,933
就是这家伙
What happened? this guy happened.

476
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,241
诸位  这是美国史上的伟大一天
It's a great day for america, everybody.

477
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:05,375
现在大家都爱上了这位超级英雄  海扁王
Everybody's favourite superhero right now. Kick-Ass, right?

478
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,417
没错
Yeah!

479
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,879
我爱海扁王  他的装扮太疯狂了
I like kick-ass. his costume is crappy.

480
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,683
看着像个异装癖
He looks like a transvestite...

481
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,158
大家都爱海扁王
You know what? everyone likes kick-ass.

482
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,260
你看那视频了吗  他还真有两下子
Did you see the clip? He was actually pretty good.

483
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,832
我看他被扁得真惨
Good at getting his ass kicked.

484
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,059
他还不如叫挨扁王呢
He should call himself ass-kick instead.

485
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,266
你真无聊
That doesn't even make sense.

486
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,977
我觉得这家伙一定死得很惨
That guy's gonna end up dead, that's what I think.

487
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,279
真的吗  我觉得他酷毙了
Are you serious? The guy owns.

488
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,873
我都想发邮件让他帮我解决麻烦
I'd e-mail his site if I had a problem worth fixing.

489
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,918
我有一百号人能帮你  你居然找个紧身裤男
I got 100 guys can fix a problem, you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?

490
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,212
但问题是你从来不让我参与你的生意
I wouldn't wanna get in the way of your 'business' where I'm not wanted.

491
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,551
我想你们猜我就是海扁王  可惜我不是
I know you have mistaken me for kick-ass, but I am not kick-ass.

492
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:58,551
伙计  抱歉  我现在太忙了  回见
消息发送成功

493
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,551
戴夫  什么时候去喝咖啡呢  凯蒂

494
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,405
其实你不看漫画吧
So you don't actually read comics?

495
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,617
我刚开始感兴趣
I just started.

496
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,777
有人给我推荐了一些
I got recommended some like Scott Pilgrim and Shojo Beat,

497
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:16,849
比如《歪小子斯科特》之类
That kinda thing.

498
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,479
可我对超级英雄还是不太感冒
I'm not really into the whole superhero thing, though.

499
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,629
我想你应该不会喜欢海扁王吧
So I guess you're not gonna line up for that new kick-ass comic, then?

500
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,900
是不喜欢  但我真想过给他发邮件
I guess not. but I was seriously thinking of mailing his site.

501
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,736
我是说  我真的有事想求他帮忙
I mean, I could really use some help from a guy like that right now.

502
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,500
是吗  什么事要他帮忙
Help? really? what with?

503
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,541
你也知道我在针头交换处做义工[为防止艾滋病]
You know I volunteer at the needle exchange?

504
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,343
不  我不知道
No, I didn't.

505
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,214
那儿有个叫拉苏尔的人  我觉得他很可怜
Well, there's this one guy, Rasul. I felt so sorry for him and...

506
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,581
知道他的抚恤金之类的事后  我就更加...
...the more I found out about his upbringing and stuff, I just...

507
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:53,749
奇怪了  通常是我安慰别人的
Wow, that's weird. I'm usually the one playing therapist.

508
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,891
我能对你坦白吗
Can I make a confession?

509
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:02,628
从很小的时候  我就一直希望能有一个
Ever since I was little I've always wanted a friend...

510
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,765
像你这样的朋友
...like you.

511
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,930
这样说行吗  其实我不讨厌同性恋
Is it okay to say that? that's not homophobic, is it?

512
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,934
当然  我觉得你还是和我们不一样
I mean, I don't think you're all the same or anything.

513
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,777
我当然不介意
Of course not, no.

514
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,283
谢谢你
Thank you.

515
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:34,992
我不知道凯蒂想要啥样的同性恋知己
I don't know if I was everything Katie dreamed her gay bff would be...

516
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,794
不过我会尽力的
...but I tried my best.

517
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,735
更重要的是  我说服她给海扁王发了邮件
More importantly, I talked her into mailing Kick-Ass.

518
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:45,710
长话短说  她的那个可怜巴巴的朋友
Long story short, this particular lame duck of hers...

519
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,042
如今成了一条地头蛇
...turned out to be more of a lame cobra.

520
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,382
她不需要他还钱
She didn't want the money back she'd given him...

521
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,374
也不接受他对自己施暴的道歉
...or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.

522
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,247
她只想让他明白他们毫无瓜葛了
She just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone.

523
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,888
说真的  我十分乐意为此效劳
And let's be real, no other request could have given me more pleasure.

524
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,203
你他妈是什么东西  蔬菜套套吗
Who the fuck are you supposed to be? The green condom?

525
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,008
小鬼  离万圣节还有几个月呢
You know it ain't halloween for another few months, kid?

526
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,077
我是来找拉苏尔的
I'm here to see Rasul.

527
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,220
你谁啊
Who the fuck are you?

528
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,521
我是海...我是凯蒂的朋友
I'm Ki... I'm a friend of Katie's.

529
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,490
现在的小屁孩都这副德行
Kids nowadays in their tights.

530
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,041
那个  你们谁是拉苏尔啊
So, which one of you guys is Rasul?

531
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,922
我就是拉苏尔  认不出我的大胸吗
I'm Rasul. can't you tell by my big titties?

532
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,133
你谁呀  玩万圣节把戏吗
What is this? trick or treat or something?

533
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,028
见鬼  我死了
Fuck. now I'm dead.

534
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,035
我给拉苏尔带个信  关于凯蒂·多玛的事
I've a message for Rasul about Katie Deauxma.

535
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,104
凯蒂
Katie?

536
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,545
这么说  你是拉苏尔咯
Oh, you're Rasul?

537
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,117
你得离凯蒂远一点  都结束了
Okay. you gotta stay away from Katie now. It's over.

538
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,914
别再纠缠她了  一切都会相安无事
So if you just leave her alone everything will be fine.

539
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,447
说什么呢
What?

540
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,326
小鬼  你以为你是谁啊
Yo, kid. who the hell are you?

541
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,057
你这什么行头
And what is this?

542
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,060
我是海扁王  别小看我
I'm kick-ass. Look me up.

543
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:55,071
就是我在给你传话  别再缠着凯蒂
And this is me giving you a message. Leave Katie alone.

544
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,846
不然怎样
Or what?

545
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,151
不然  我就会回来
Or... I'll come back...

546
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,420
打断你的贱腿
...and break your fucking legs.

547
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,930
我不逃也不躲  来吧
I'm right here now, baby.

548
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,573
我操
Fuck!

549
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,536
抓住他
Hold him.

550
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,416
你他妈死定了  小子
You are so fucking dead, man.

551
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,641
好了  婊子们  让姑奶奶瞧瞧你们的能耐
Okay, you cunts. Let's see what you can do now.

552
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,341
一二三四五
Eeny, meeny...

553
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,571
上山打老虎
...miny, mo.

554
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,595
搞什么
What the fuck?!

555
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,962
我也有一把哟
Hey, I got one of those.

556
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,639
来吧
Come on.

557
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,118
这么说你想玩咯
So you wanna play.

558
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,196
搞毛
What the fuck?

559
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,969
老兄  居然用电击枪  太娘了吧
Oh, dude, that is one gay-looking taser.

560
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,345
别紧张  我们是一伙的
Relax, we're on the same team.

561
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:54,949
起来吧
Hey, get up.

562
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:05,392
超杀女  永远别忘记  背要朝向哪儿
Now, hit girl, we always keep our backs where?

563
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,430
朝向墙  爸爸  我知道  下不为例
To the wall, daddy, I know. it won't happen again.

564
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,263
-对了  枪法真准  -谢谢
- Nice shot, by the way. - Thank you.

565
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,277
我们走吧
Let's go.

566
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,291
傻子  不能走前门
Hey, asshole, you can't use the front door now.

567
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,068
等一下
Wait, wait, wait.

568
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,410
什么
What?

569
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,946
你是谁
Who are you?

570
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,037
我吗
Me?

571
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,582
我是超杀女
I'm Hit Girl.

572
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,911
那是大老爸
Big Daddy.

573
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,028
快来
Come on.

574
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,563
过来呀
Come on!

575
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,003
超杀女和大老爸
Hit girl and Big Daddy.

576
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,766
他们才是真英雄
They were the real deal.

577
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,304
而我呢
Me?

578
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,881
就一个穿潜水服的傻帽
I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.

579
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,764
这是什么  这到底是什么
What is this? what am I looking at here?

580
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,272
是萨尔的手机  在他手里发现的
It was Sal's phone. They found it in his hand.

581
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,841
应该是他在死前拍下
He must have taken that right before he died.

582
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:34,572
我知道这很扯淡  阿弗  但是那照片里的家伙
I know this sounds fucked-up, Frankie, but that guy in the picture...

583
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,642
应该就是电视上的那个超级英雄
...I think it's that superhero nut job from the tv.

584
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:39,816
谁
Who?

585
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,284
海扁王
Kick-Ass?

586
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,118
就他一个人
One guy?

587
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:48,047
等等  你是说  他一人一晚上杀了我的八个人
Hold on, you're telling me one guy killed 8 of my men tonight?

588
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:56,793
萨尔那儿的八个  拉苏尔那边是四个
8 at Sal's place. 4 at that kid Rasul's.

589
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,304
那我们街上的生意都砸了吗
We have no merchandise on the street at all?

590
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,396
对
Right.

591
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,404
-真的就他一个吗  -我觉得是
- One guy? - I think.

592
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,704
如果这是真的  那我们岂不成了纽约最大的冤大头
If you're right, we'll look like the biggest pussies in new york.

593
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,805
您有何吩咐
What do you want me to do?

594
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:18,820
我要你马上给我送上那傻逼海扁王的人头
I want kick-ass's fucking head on a stick, and I want it now.

595
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,459
我发誓  我没对任何人说过
I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.

596
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:34,697
不错嘛  挨扁王  继续保持
Good move, Ass... kick. Let's keep it that way.

597
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,464
认识这玩意吧
You know what this is?

598
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,016
这是你的娘们电击枪
It's all the cartridge crap that comes

599
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:42,004
留下来的弹夹
Out of your gay little taser when you fire it.

600
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,802
你该知道警察发现后
You do know the police could have traced

601
00:44:43,802 --> 00:44:45,511
会立刻展开追查吧
This right back to you if they'd found it?

602
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,810
算你走运  我捡起来了
But lucky for you... I picked it up.

603
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,079
谢谢
Thank you.

604
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:56,160
保险起见还是我们拿着吧  也好让我们信任你
Let's call it insurance. makes it easier for us to take your word.

605
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,561
听着  我们喜欢你  但是不信任你
See, we like you, but we don't trust you.

606
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,500
对事不对人  我们谁都不信
Don't take it personal. we don't trust anybody.

607
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,003
我变更了你的IP地址
I re-routed your IP address.

608
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,666
不然他们能轻易找到你
Finding you was way too easy.

609
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:14,378
该死  我怎么没想到  天啊
Oh, shit. shit, I hadn't thought. my god.

610
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,744
我欠你们的
I, I owe you.

611
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,880
我正打算关闭我的网站
I'm thinking of shutting my site down anyway.

612
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,616
我是说我不干了  这太疯狂了
Quitting. I mean, this is... it's fucking insane.

613
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,091
真是超出我的想像
I'm in way over my head.

614
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,393
真可惜  你很有潜质
It's a shame. you have potential.

615
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,829
由你决定  如有需要  我们一直在你身边
Your call. but you know we're around if you need us.

616
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,766
我怎么联系你们
How do I get a hold of you?

617
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,568
你只需联系市长办公室
You just contact the mayor's office.

618
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,934
他会向天空投射信号
He has a special signal he shines in the sky.

619
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,969
是个巨大老二的形状
In the shape of a giant cock.

620
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,310
需要我们的话  就在网站上写"度假中"  我们会找到你
You need us, put on your website you're on vacation. we'll find you.

621
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,834
超杀女  返回总部
Hit girl, back to headquarters.

622
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,540
好梦
Sweet dreams.

623
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,690
我要你做掉海扁王
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

624
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,250
-怎么了  -什么怎么了
- Yo. whoa, whoa, whoa. what's up? - What's up?

625
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,685
海扁王在毁掉我的生意  希甘特
Kick-Ass is killing my men, gigante, that's what's up.

626
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,193
我很遗憾  弗兰克
My condolences, Frank.

627
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,869
但这次恐怕我帮不了你
But I'm afraid I can't help you on this one.

628
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,873
-这有点超出我的职权范围了  -你说什么
- little bit outside my jurisdiction. - Outside your jurisdiction?

629
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,741
你他妈的不是警察吗  他这是在干违法勾当
You're a fucking cop and he's breaking the law.

630
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:21,078
这事不该你管他妈的该谁管
That's so inside it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass.

631
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,170
听我说
Listen to me.

632
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,711
我拿工资抓坏人  你则贿赂我不要抓坏人
The cops pay me to nail the bad guys. you pay me not to.

633
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,730
-其它都是灰色地带的事  -滚你妈的  照做就是
- Everything else is in the grey area. - fuck you very much. just do it.

634
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,116
明白吗
Okay.

635
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,720
真他妈难以置信
Un-fucking-believable.

636
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,156
柯迪人呢  他迟到了
Where's Cody? he's late.

637
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,961
谢谢  柯迪  感谢你的合作
Thank you, Cody. We appreciate your co-operation.

638
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,734
能放我走了吗
Let me out now?

639
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,861
我把名字和地址都给你们了
I gave you all them names and addresses.

640
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,338
我不会和任何人说的
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

641
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,908
你和你的矮个朋友去随心所欲打击邪恶吧
You and your crazy midget friend can go bash whoever you want.

642
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:51,608
拜托
Hey, come on.

643
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:55,312
我认识一些城里的坏蛋  坏到极点了
Hey, I know some very bad people up town. really nasty individuals.

644
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,147
放我走吧  求你了
Let me go. hey, come on.

645
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,809
别这样  你们别这样  求你了
Hey, hey, don't do this. you don't need to do this. come on.

646
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,216
求你们了
Please. hey.

647
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,380
拜托  不要
Come on, no, no...

648
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,623
不要  求求你们
No, no, no! come on, please!

649
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,029
你们疯了
Hey, you're crazy. please!

650
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,071
真是个废渣
What a douche.

651
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,957
你之前也涂过护肤霜吧
You have done self tan before, right?

652
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,154
没错  家常便饭
Yeah, like, I do it all the time.

653
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,095
谋杀  超级英雄夜闯卧室
Murder, superheroes breaking into my bedroom.

654
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,931
我的生活完全成了个扯淡而醒不来的梦
My life had turned into some fucked-up dream I couldn't wake up from.

655
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,936
就连这美好的一刻也是那么梦幻
Even the good parts were totally surreal.

656
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,011
我看了你给我的《蜘蛛侠》故事
Oh, hey, I read those old Ditko Spidermans you gave me.

657
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,444
真的非常不错
They're actually pretty good.

658
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,113
当然啦
Yeah, they are.

659
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,381
而且拉苏尔有一星期没找我了
And it's been a whole week since I've heard from Rasul.

660
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,988
那真是太好了
That's great.

661
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:14,444
很久以前  有两个超级警察  老爸和马库斯
Once upon a time there were 2 supercops called Daddy and Marcus...

662
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,144
他们非常擅于惩奸除恶
...who were very good at getting bad guys.

663
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,224
弗兰克·达米科是个罪大恶极的恶棍
Frank D'Amico was the baddest guy of them all...

664
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,224
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}马上给我找希甘特警探

665
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:24,421
他想出了一个陷害老爸的招数
...and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy.

666
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,298
给我搜

667
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,633
对老爸来说  被陷害为一个毒贩
Being framed as a drug dealer was the

668
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,600
是最糟糕不过的事情
Worst thing that could have happened to daddy.

669
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,600
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}罪名成立

670
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,106
监狱不该是他的栖息之地
Prison was not his natural habitat.

671
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,307
他非常沮丧
He was very upset.

672
00:49:42,307 --> 00:49:44,581
英雄警察入狱

673
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:48,783
老爸入狱后  他那怀有身孕的妻子孤身一人
With daddy in prison, his pregnant wife was all alone...

674
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,952
无法接受这一事实
...and could not cope.

675
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:58,551
但就在她死后  柳暗花明又一村
But all clouds have a silver lining and out of her death...

676
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,490
敏蒂降生了
...Mindy was born.

677
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,329
马库斯成了孩子的监护人
Marcus became the child's guardian...

678
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,540
而老爸则着手于他的计划
...and daddy started a plan of his very own.

679
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:16,669
5年后  他出狱了  已经蓄势待发
5 years later he left prison, and he was ready.

680
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,120
现在  该敏蒂整装就绪了
Now it was time for Mindy to get ready, too.

681
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,762
你是怎么找到我的  马库斯
How did you find me, Marcus?

682
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,965
忘了吗  我还是警察 
One of us is still a cop, remember?

683
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,677
你就是这样对敏蒂洗脑的吗
Is this how you brainwashed Mindy?

684
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,447
你觉得是洗脑  我觉得是场游戏
You say brainwashed, I say made it into a game.

685
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,244
你觉得这很好玩吗  达蒙
You call this playing, Damon?

686
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,909
私自执法  肆意屠杀  得了  拍档
Vigilante justice. mass murder. come on, partner.

687
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,412
她在哪儿
So where is she?

688
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,847
-她很安全  -我能见见她吗
- She's safe. - Can I see her?

689
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,926
我很想她
I miss her.

690
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,531
我很想你们
I miss you both.

691
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:13,163
谢谢你的关心  但你该走了
I appreciate your concern, but you need to go now.

692
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:22,412
我得提醒你  希甘特那混蛋在找海扁王
I should warn you, that asshole Gigante is looking for kick-ass.

693
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,277
你们和他有牵连吗  达蒙
He got something to do with you, Damon?

694
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,951
你是不是组成了什么超级英雄团队
You started some kind of fucked-up superhero club?

695
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:31,352
-从没听过他  -好吧  小心点  好吗
- Never heard of him. - Okay. heads up, all right?

696
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,423
你要是这么继续下去
You keep carrying on like you been carrying on,

697
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,187
希甘特盯上你也只是时间问题而已
It's only a matter of time before Gigante is looking for you.

698
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,461
自从你拒绝了之后  他就一直为达米科做事
He's been on D'Amico's payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity.

699
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,031
你知道我不会罢手的
You know I'm not gonna stop.

700
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,269
直到达米科和他的组织粉碎殆尽
Not until D'Amico and his whole damn operation...

701
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,364
入土成灰
...are burnt to ashes and buried.

702
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,508
你就不该把她卷进来  达蒙
It ain't gonna bring her back, damon.

703
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,271
这不该是敏蒂的生活
This is not the life for Mindy.

704
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,976
你欠她一个童年
You owe that kid a childhood.

705
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,414
我告诉你是谁欠了她的童年
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood.

706
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,883
弗兰克·达米科
Frank D'Amico!

707
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,373
我靠
Holy shit.

708
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,443
真他妈难以置信
I don't fucking believe it.

709
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,149
跟着他  转弯
Follow him, round the corner.

710
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,453
别太快
Not too fast.

711
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,625
他居然还和路人击掌
What's with the high-fives?

712
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,191
等我给你来上一拳
I'll give you a motherfucking high-five.

713
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,132
狠狠地一拳  要你好看  跟上去
High-fiving bullshit. keep going, keep going.

714
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,837
别太近
Not too close.

715
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,403
他进了小巷
He's going in the alley.

716
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,905
进到小巷里去了
He's going in the alley.

717
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,877
我叫你停车就停车  好吗
Okay, when I tell you, stop the car. ready?

718
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,290
喂  海扁王
Hey, kick-ass.

719
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,652
你好吗
How you doing?

720
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,488
你敢杀我的人  还偷我的货
Kill my men, huh? take my fucking coke!

721
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,735
老大  你在干什么
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss. what are you doing?

722
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:26,803
老大  我们得走了
Boss, come on, we gotta go, baby.

723
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:27,735
-傻逼废物  -快走吧
- Fucking scumbag! - Come on, let's go.

724
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,706
老大  别打了  你打够了
Boss, come on, he's had enough.

725
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,503
走吧  弗兰克  他够惨了
Come on, Frank, he's had enough. come on.

726
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,234
你他妈看什么看
What the fuck are you looking at? huh?

727
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,392
好了  我们走吧
Come on, come on. come on, let's go. we gotta go.

728
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,129
日你妈的
Fuck. shit. damn.

729
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,289
上车吧
Come on, come on, get in.

730
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,900
他还那么年轻  怎么就这么死了
He was so young. no-one should have to die that way.

731
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,700
真不敢相信他已经死了
I just can't believe he's dead, that's all.

732
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,600
我知道  但是  凯蒂...
Oh, I know. but, Katie...

733
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,300
像拉苏尔这样的人  背景十分复杂
...guys like Rasul get mixed up in stuff and...

734
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,600
我知道  但万一这是我的错呢
No, I know, I know, but what if it was my fault?

735
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,200
如果这是海扁王做的呢   我觉得我该报警
What if kick-ass did it? I feel like I should call the cops or something.

736
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,900
你说什么傻话  这不可能
You're talking crazy. there's no way.

737
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,200
估计他都没看过你的邮件
He probably didn't even read your email yet.

738
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,900
也是
Yeah.

739
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,800
你没必要担心
You got nothing to worry about.

740
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,000
我真庆幸你在这儿  我真是一团糟
I'm so glad you're here. I'm in such a mess.

741
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,700
没关系  这没什么
That's okay. it's not a problem.

742
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,200
你最好了
You're the best.

743
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,900
希望你别介意  但是你要不是同性恋就好了
I hope it's okay to say this, but... it so sucks that you're gay.

744
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,100
这简直是鬼扯
I don't fucking believe this.

745
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,100
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}海扁王模仿者被杀

746
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,600
哪门子小鬼会拿这种当消遣
What kind of children's enter-fuckingtainer is that?

747
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,700
究竟是哪门子...
What kind of kid has a...

748
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,500
开个蜘蛛侠派对也就算了  但搞个海扁王派对
...a spiderman party, sure, but a fucking kick-ass party?

749
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,200
他们在商店里卖纸巾和纸碟吗
They selling paper plates and napkins at the store now?

750
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,100
弗兰克  你吓到我了  你已经疯了
Frank, you're scaring me. you're losing it.

751
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,100
你居然在大庭广众下公开杀人
Since when did you start getting your hands dirty again? and in public.

752
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,289
就因为你没给我送来海扁王的首级
Since when I asked you fucks to deliver me kick-ass and you don't deliver,

753
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:13,900
就这原因
That's when.

754
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,900
给我点时间  才过了一周
Give me a break, it's been a week.

755
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,400
我们有一半人出去犯事  就为了引他出来
We got half the crew out doing petty crimes as bait.

756
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
忙得焦头烂额
We're busting our asses here.

757
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,500
你到底在干嘛
What the hell are you doing?

758
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,200
你啥时又开始吸粉了
You're back on the powder now as well?

759
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,700
妈咪  我想开个海扁王派对  大惊小怪的傻子
Mommy, I want a kick-ass party. dumb little fucks.

760
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
我知道抓到他的方法
I know a way you can get him.

761
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
见鬼
Shit!

762
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,900
克里斯  你在外面多久了
Chris, how long you been there?

763
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,300
你到底搞什么鬼  快滚
What the hell are you doing? Get the hell out.

764
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,200
-你到底想不想听  -什么
- Do you wanna hear it or not? - Hear what?

765
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,400
听着  如果你是个超级英雄
Okay, look. you're a superhero and...

766
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,900
你信不过任何人  因为他们会暴露你的秘密身份
...you can't trust anyone because they'll expose your secret identity...

767
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,200
现在的孩子只会看漫画书
Comic books this kid reads, all fucking day long.

768
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,996
问题是  只有一个办法能让超级英雄信任陌生人
The point is, there's only one way a superhero can trust a stranger, and..

769
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,500
我可以做那个人  给我个机会
...I can be that stranger. you've just gotta give me a chance.

770
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,100
我能做到  就是需要些东西
I know I can do it. I just need a few things.

771
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,900
什么东西
Like what?

772
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,500
就这些东西
I need these things.

773
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,600
啥  你他妈开什么玩笑  这算什么鬼
What, are you fucking kidding me? what the hell is this?

774
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,400
这是我需要的一切
It's, it's everything I need.

775
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,000
但你得牺牲一个人  比如说路易
And you might have to screw someone over like Louie, or something.

776
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,500
为什么是路易  克里斯
Louie? oh, hey, Chris. uhhuh.

777
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,800
其他人也行  不一定要路易
Or, or somebody. it doesn't have to be Louie.

778
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,800
-托尼  -托尼
- Tony. - Tony.

779
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,800
托尼吗
Tony?

780
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,400
-我讨厌托尼  -对  托尼他就是个混球
- I hate tony. - Yeah, fuck Tony. he's a scumbag.

781
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,900
我保证  老爸  要是你同意  一定会有用
I swear, dad, if you let me do this, it's gonna work.

782
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
那就托尼吧
Tony.

今日在皇后区被捕

785
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,300
警方称报案人是个超级英雄
...after a 911 call from someone claiming to be a superhero...

786
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,900
你和凯蒂的事怎么样了
So, how are things going with Katie?

787
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,800
还算顺利
Oh, just peachy.

788
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
我们通宵未睡
We had a sleepover and spent the whole night...

789
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,400
看完了《丑女贝蒂》  还做了足疗
...watching the entire 'ugly betty' box set and did pedicures.

790
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,600
我告诉你  这事拖得越久越糟
I'm telling you, the, the longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get.

791
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,300
我知道  我会告诉她的  只是她一直这么开心
I know. I was gonna tell her. she seemed so happy.

792
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,200
-找不到合适的时机  -你的机会来了
- I don't know when's the right time. - Well, now's your chance.

793
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,100
-她没看到吧  -好啊  伙计们
- She didn't see that, did she? - Hey, guys.

794
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,300
-好啊  -你好
- Hi. - Hi, sweet.

795
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,000
你们看电视新闻了吗  那个新超级英雄
Did you watch the tv? the new superhero guy?

796
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,500
多酷啊
How cool is that?

797
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,200

看吧
Check this out.

800
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,200
不再袖手旁观  这位自称红旋风的人士
Far from being put off, this individual, who calls himself red mist...

801
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,400
决定将打击犯罪提升到新的高度
...has decided to take crime fighting to a new level...

802
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,200
他昨晚的行动证明了这一点
...as his actions last night proved.

803
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,901
-红旋风  你怎么看  -我觉得大家都受够了担惊受怕
- Red mist, how do you see it? - Folks have had enough of living in fear..

804
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,300
而海扁王证明了个人也可以成大事
...and Kick-Ass proved that one individual can make a difference.

805
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,300
如果有人需要帮助  我会全天候打击犯罪
So if anyone out there needs help, I'll be fighting crime 25/8.

806
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,400

And I'm just one click away. red mist. org.

807
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,400
能关了吗
Can we turn that off now?

808
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,600
那家伙有什么神的
What's so special about that guy?

809
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,500
他抓住了一个毒贩  是一级通缉犯
He caught a drug dealer. some most wanted guy.

810
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,800
-你看他把一大堆缴获的东西拿出来  -真酷
- You saw him bring out a ton of stuff. - That's pretty cool.

811
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,700
对啊  比海扁王的装扮更酷
Yeah, he's got a way better costume than kick-ass, too.

812
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,100
-他还穿了斗篷  -是啊
- He's got a cape. - Yeah.

813
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,300
斗篷最赞了
Capes rock.

814
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,700
我觉得斗篷不错  看着不赖
I'm kinda feeling the cape. looks good.

815
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,300
什么  你觉得那家伙比海扁王更好吗
What, better than kick-ass?

816
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,900
他俩都挺帅的  但我觉得红旋风的身材更好
They're both kinda hot. I just think red mist has a better body.

817
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,400
你觉得呢  戴夫
Don't you think, Dave?

818
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,600
是啊  戴夫
Yeah, Dave, what do you think? Is that the...

819
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,800
你不就喜欢这种人吗  一身皮衣
...is he the kinda guy you'd go for, with the, all that leather?

820
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,900
不  小马  我不喜欢这一型
No, Marty, he's not really my type.

821
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,500
约个时间地点  咱出来聚聚吧

822
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,000
海扁王

823
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,300
红旋风

824
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,100
该死  真疼
Oh, shit. fuck me, that kinda hurt.

825

-你没事吧  -我没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah. no, I'm cool.

826
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,400
我不敢相信能见到本尊  老兄  你是我的大英雄
I can't believe you're here, man. like, you're my hero.

827
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,800
你激励了我  说真的  没有海扁王就没有红旋风
You inspired me. no kick-ass, no red mist. seriously.

828
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,000
是吗
Wow. hey, really?

829
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,300
一点不假  听着  如果你...
Straight up. and listen, if you...

830
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,700
要我做你助手啥的...
...wanted me to be your sidekick or something...

831
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,900
你想做我助手吗
You wanna be my sidekick?

832
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,700
当然  你我联手  所向披靡
Yeah, man. you and me together, we would own.

833
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,800
你想去打击犯罪吗
You wanna go fight some crime?

834
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,200
你说现在吗
Oh, what you mean like right now?

835
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,400
是啊  来吧  我有东西给你看
Yeah, man. come on, I got something I wanna show you.

836
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,500
实话告诉你
Er, I mean, like to be honest with you,

837
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,300
我只在每周日晚九点到两点打击犯罪
I only ever fight crime between like 9 and 2 weekdays.

838
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,500
所以我们就快点完事
So I'm gonna need to get back pretty soon.

839
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,200
赞
Sweet.

840
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,800

- Is that yours? - Meet the mist mobile.

841
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,300
我的iPhone能自动导航  所以能边开车
Satnav got my iPhone so I can check the websites for emergencies

842
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,800
边查看网站上的紧急情况
When we're driving around.

843
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,600
还能来点灯光应应景
Got a little bit of mood lighting right there.

844
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,200
有后视镜  没什么大不了
Rear-view camera. no big deal.

845
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,300
看看这个  包你爱不释手

846
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,400
雾来咯
The mist.

847
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,400
没错  我们是超级英雄  爱戴我们吧
That's right, we're superheroes, love us.

848
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,500
-抽烟吗  -不抽
- Smoke? - No.

849
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,495
巡逻的时候  来点烟草能壮壮胆
I feel a little weed takes the edge off things when I'm on patrol,

850
01:00:59,495 --> 01:00:59,900
知道吗
You know.

851
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,600
面对一大堆人群  还真有点害怕  你觉得呢
Going up against a crowd can get kinda scary, don't you think?

852
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,500
怎么了
Something wrong?

853
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,800
你和我想象的完全不同
You're so not how I expected.

854
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,600
我从一个女孩那儿收到一封邮件
I got this e-mail from this chick.

855
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,500
说有人总在上下班时尾随她
She said this guy's been following her home from work.

856
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,800
我有地址  想探探情况吗
I got her address and stuff. you wanna check it out?

857
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,100
-好啊  何不呢  -酷
- Sure. why not? - Cool.

858
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,800
我们一丝不挂地坐在那里
So, we're sitting there totally naked, right?

859
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,901
我告诉她  坐在我膝盖上
So I told her, "sit on my lap,

860
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,800
我们再谈谈是啥玩意先出来
We'll talk about the first thing that comes up".

861
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,900
-怎么  -刚收到短信  他在路上了
- Yeah? - Just got the text. he's on his way.

862
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,400
很好
He did very good.

863
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,400
-在我到之前留他活口  -好
- Don't kill him till I get there. - Right.

864
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,400
看来钻研漫画终于有收获了吧
Looks like reading all them comics paid off, huh?

865
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
你儿子干得不错  阿弗
Your boy did good, Frankie.

866
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,700
虎父焉有犬子
He's his father's son.

867
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,300
你你你你你以为
Come on now who do you

868
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,500
你你你你你以为
Who do you who do you

869
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,700
你以为自己是谁
Who do you think you are?

870
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,200
祈求上帝保佑你
Bless your soul

871
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,900
差点忘了
Oh... I forgot.

872
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,100
你一准是疯了
I think you're crazy

873
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,000
你一准是疯了
I think you're crazy

874
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,300
你一准是疯了
I think you're crazy

875
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,700
就如同我一样
Just like me

876
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:58,000
我的英雄啊  陷入孤立无援也在所不惜
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb

877
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,900
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?!

878
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,900

- Hey, what are you doing? - There are people in there!

880
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,900

881
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,700

进来
Come.

896
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,400
弗兰克  你他妈搞什么
What the hell are you doing, Frank?

897
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,300
我不能来这儿  万一被人看到怎么办
You know I can't be here. What if somebody saw me?

898
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,049
那个混账海扁王烧了我的仓库  还干掉了我的人
That motherfucker kick-Ass burnt down my warehouse and killed my men,

899
01:05:46,049 --> 01:05:46,600
希甘特
Gigante.

900
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,600
等下  说慢点  你确定是海扁王吗
Wait, wait, wait. slow down. Kick-Ass? are you sure?

901
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,200
你得帮我  我儿子也在里面  还下落不明
You gotta help me, vic. My son was there and he's still missing.

902
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,400
他们都死了
They're all dead!

903
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,700
仓库里的所有人都死了
Everybody in the warehouse is dead.

904
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,100

- Put the gun down, Vic, it's Chris. - Chris is red mist?

905
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,500
红旋风不用你操心  你该操心海扁王
It's not red mist you gotta worry about. it's Kick-Ass.

906
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,400
不不不  海扁王就是个宅男  老爸
No, no, no, it's not. Kick-Ass is just some geek, dad.

907
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,500
你不用在意他  你得看看这个
You don't have to worry about him. you need to watch this.

908
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,100
-这是什么玩意  -你搞笑吧

910
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,700
真他妈见鬼  坐下就是
God-damn it, just sit down.

911
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
你做什么  那到底是什么东西
What are you doing? What the hell is that thing?

912
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
你在我小时候买的  用来监视保姆
You bought this to spy on the nanny when I was a kid.

913
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,400
忘了吗
Don't you remember?

914
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,700
-你放在仓库了吗  -对
- And you put it in the warehouse? - Yeah.

915
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,613
我觉得把海扁王的真面目放到网上肯定很酷
I thought it'd be cool to put the unmasking of kick-ass on the internet.

916
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,400
仔细看
Watch.

917
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,092
我告诉她  坐在我膝盖上
I told her, "sit on my lap,

918
01:06:43,092 --> 01:06:45,000
我们再谈谈是啥玩意先出来
We'll talk about the first thing that comes up".

919
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,300
-怎么  -刚收到短信  他在路上了
- Yeah? - Just got the text. he's on his way.

920
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,300
很好  在我到之前留他活口
He did very good. don't kill him till I get there.

921
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,300
好
Right.

922
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,900
这家伙到底是谁
Who the hell is this guy?

923
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,900
我不知道  老爸
I don't know, dad.

924
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,400
但听海扁王说  城里不止他一个超级英雄
But Kick-Ass told me we're not the only superheroes in town.

925
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,600
也许他知道他是谁
Maybe he knows who this guy is.

926
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,400
封锁这个地方
I want this place locked down.

927
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,000
在找到这天杀的混球
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out.

928
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
把他给我千刀万剐之前
Not until somebody finds this cocksucker...

929
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,200
任何人不得随意进出
...and pulls his fucking lungs out through his ass!

930
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,600
听着  他们冲着你来了  听到吗
Listen, they're on to you. do you hear me?

931
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,900
他们盯上你了
They're on to you.

932
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,400
他们不是在找海扁王吗
I thought they were looking for Kick-Ass.

933
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,300
不再找了  希甘特刚放了一段视频给我们看
Not any more. gigante put on a movie show for us.

934
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,700
另一个超级英雄
Different superhero.

935
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,200
在仓库里血洗达米科的人
In a warehouse, killing a whole bunch of D'Amico's guys.

936
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,300
我猜那人就是你
I'm gonna guess that was you.

937
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,400
-我毁掉了所有摄像头  -显然有漏网之鱼  听着  兄弟
- I killed all the cameras. - Apparently not. look, bro...

938
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,200
你得跑路了  赶紧藏起来
...you need to get ghost, hide yourself quick.

939
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,600
谢谢提醒
Appreciate that.

940
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,000
敏蒂  别写作业了  宝贝儿
Mindy... no more homework, baby doll.

941
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,500
该跟弗兰克·达米科说再见了
It's time for Frank D'Amico to go byebye.

942
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,200
X战警  神奇四侠
X-Men, the Fantastic Four.

943
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,200
现在  我真是嫉妒死他们了
Right now, I envied the crap out of them.

944
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:34,600
现在一切都失控了  我完全不知所措
Everything was out of control. I didn't know what the hell to do.

945
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,700
你还好吧  孩子  看着很疲惫
You okay, buddy? you look tired.

946
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,300
今天早点睡吧
Early night tonight, maybe?

947
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,200
也无人能够倾诉
And there was no-one I could talk to about it.

948
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,700
戴夫  听见吗
Dave? hello?

949
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,300
好吧  我会的
Yeah, you bet I will.

950
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,600
我从未感到如此孤独
I never felt more alone.

951
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,800
我一直梦想成为超级英雄
I'd always dreamed of being a superhero...

952
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,900
但结果却是一场噩梦
...but this was a nightmare.

953
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,300
是时候结束这愚蠢的游戏了
It was time to stop wearing this stupid costume.

954
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,700
但我还有最后一件事要做
But there was one last thing I needed it for.

955
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,400
彼得·帕克[蜘蛛侠的真实身份]和蜘蛛侠有什么区别
What's the difference between Spiderman and Peter Parker?

956
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,900
蜘蛛侠抱得美人归
Spiderman gets the girl.

957
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,600
我是海扁王
Hey, I'm Kick-Ass.

958
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,700
我是海扁王  你给我写邮件了吗
I'm Kick-Ass. you mail me?

959
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,500
拜托
Please.

960
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,400
见鬼
Oh, fuck! oh, fuck!

961
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,300
戴面具的变态
Fucking freak in a mask!

962
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,800
-滚出去  -凯蒂  我不会伤害你
- Get out of my house! - Katie, I'm not gonna hurt you.

963
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,500
好吗
All right?

964
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,000
别别别  是我
Oh, no, no, no, it's me, it's me. all right?

965
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,100
-我只是想给你个惊喜  -戴夫
- I, I was only trying to surprise you, I'm sorry. - Dave?

966
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,000
你搞什么鬼  你干嘛穿成海扁王的样子
What the fuck are you doing? why are you dressed as Kick-Ass?

967
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,500
-因为我就是海扁王  -你说什么
- Because I am Kick-Ass. - what are you talking about?

968
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,900
而且我也不是同性恋
And I'm also not gay.

969
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,600
我靠
Fuck!

970
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,300
我是个傻瓜  烂朋友  我骗了你
And I'm an idiot, and a shit friend. I lied to you, I know, and if...

971
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,100
我的上帝
Oh my god.

972
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,800
我知道  要是这样能让你好受点
I know. If it makes you feel any better,

973
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,400
我觉得现在我比你更恨我自己
I, I don't think you can hate me any more right now than I hate myself.

974
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,700
求你了
Please...

975
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,800
听着  我真的很抱歉
...look, I'm really, really sorry.

976
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:27,700
我从没遇到过像你这样又漂亮又善良
I've never met anyone who's as beautiful and as kind and...

977
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,900
又可爱的女孩儿
...lovely as you.

978
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,200
你该有个更好的归宿
You deserve better.

979
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,800
戴夫
Dave.

980
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,100
怎么
Yes?

981
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,246
我妈在楼下设了防盗警报
My mom has the burglar alarm on downstairs,

982
01:11:59,246 --> 01:12:01,100
你还是从窗户出去吧
So you should probably use the window.

983
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,600
或者
Or...

984
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,100
或者你可以留下来
...or you could just stay.

985
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,900
留下来  再通宵一晚上吗
Stay? What like when we have a sleepover?

986
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,900
不好意思  我不是故意要吓你
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

987
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,000
好吧
Well...

988
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,300
我们要过这一关
We gotta get over it...

989
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,400
得到顶上  然后再从中间进去
...on top of it and then into it. right in the middle of it.

990
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,300
老爸  我想我找到了
Daddy, I think I've found one.

991
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,400
超完美  三天内送达
It's perfect and they can deliver it in 3 days.

992
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,500
但要三千块
Ah, it's 300,000 bucks.

993
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,600
没有比那更好的了吗
Well, can you think of anything else you'd rather spend it on?

994
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,400
天啊  酷毙了
Oh my gosh. that is cool.

995
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,700
可不是
Yeah.

996
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,200
放入购物车
Add to shopping cart.

997
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,600
没问题
Okay.

998
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,000
海扁王和红旋风对打  谁会赢
Out of Kick-Ass and Red Mist, who would win in a fight?

999
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,500
为啥他们要打  听着好傻
Why are they fighting? that seems stupid.

1000
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,000
-你觉得呢  -我不知道
- What do you think? - I don't know,

1001
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,700
我觉得海扁王更可爱些
But Kick-Ass is cuter.

1002
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:43,900
是吗
Really?

1003
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,100
当然
Mmm-hmm.

1004
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,200
只要有机会  我一定干到他大脑窒息
I for one would definitely fuck his brains out if I got the chance.

1005
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,500
-是吗  -当然
- You would? - Definitely.

1006
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,300
你想看凯特·哈德森[美国影星]的新电影吗
Do you feel like checking out that new Kate Hudson movie...

1007
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,200
她演一个剩女鞋子设计师
...where she's a shoe designer who can't get a guy?

1008
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,500
-现在走的话还能赶上下一场  -别废话了  走
- we could make the next showing... - Hell, yeah.

1009
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,400
估计没咱啥事了
Guess we're not invited.

1010
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,100
来这边
You know what? Come here.

1011
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,200
我要把你培养成一个漫迷
I'm gonna convert you to a comics reader right now.

1012
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:17,000
我突然明白为什么超级英雄只存在漫画中
Suddenly I understood why superheroes only existed in comic books.

1013
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,300
我明白了为何人们不会为了陌生人而冒险
I got why people didn't risk their lives for strangers.

1014
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,900
因为我的生命中头一次有了意义
Because, for the first time in my life, I had something worth living for.

1015
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,000
有了害怕失去的东西
Something to lose.

1016
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,191
凯蒂担心我会受伤
Katie worried about me getting hurt,

1017
01:14:31,191 --> 01:14:34,000
所以我向她保证  我的海扁王岁月终结了
So I promised her my Kick-Ass days were over.

1018
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,300
事实上  我并不怀念那段岁月
And the truth was I hardly missed it at all.

1019
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,700
我一整周都没有看过网站了
I hadn't even checked the website for, like, a week.

1020
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,700
戴夫  我下班了
Okay, I'm off, then.

1021
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,800
凯蒂今晚不来吗
No Katie tonight?

1022
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,900
明天来  周三她要做义工
Tomorrow. Wednesday, she's got one of those volunteer things.

1023
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,000
你看起来焕然一新  知道吗
You seem like a different guy, you know that?

1024
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,400
你妈看到你现在的样子会很欣慰的
Your mom would have been so happy to see you out of your shell like this.

1025
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,800
晚安
Have a good night.

1026
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
老兄  你到底在哪儿
出来碰个面  红旋风

1027
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,100
宝贝儿
Hey, baby.

1028
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,800
怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

1029
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,100
我得执行一个海扁王任务
I gotta do a Kick-Ass thing.

1030
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,000
什么  你不是洗手不干了吗
What? I thought you were done with that.

1031
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,400
最后一次  我保证
This is the last time. I totally swear.

1032
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,000
我很担心你
I worry about you.

1033
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,800
你不用担心
Well, I wish you wouldn't worry.

1034
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,900
我控制不住  因为...
I can't help it, I do because I...

1035
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,100
我非常在乎你
...I care about you a lot.

1036
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,400
我也非常在乎你
I care about you a lot, too.

1037
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,500
最好是要紧事  老兄
This better be pretty serious, dude.

1038
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,900
我跟我女友保证我不再干了
Cos I promised my girlfriend that I'm done with all this shit.

1039
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,200
我们都死定了  够要紧了吗
How about both of us being dead? is that serious enough for you?

1040
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,600
什么  怎么会死
Dead? how?

1041
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,100
看来那群仓库里的死人
Well, it turns out those dead guys from the warehouse

1042
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,600
有一帮混账坏蛋朋友  他们认定是我们干的
Had some bad motherfuckers for friends, and they think we did that shit.

1043
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,400
他们在悬赏我们的人头
There's a price on our heads, man.

1044
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,000
啥  这都什么年代了  还搞西部这一套
A price on our heads? what is this, the wild west?

1045
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,800
我没跟你扯淡  他们追到我家
I'm not messing with you, dude. they found out where I lived.

1046
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,800
毁了我的住处  我他妈完蛋了
They trashed my place. I'm fucking screwed,

1047
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
-下一个就轮到你了  明白吗  -好吧
- and you're next, okay! - All right. what?

1048
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,800
真该死
Shit.

1049
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,500
我们怎么办
What do we do?

1050
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,600
记得你说过还有别的超级英雄吗
Remember you mentioned that there are other superheroes?

1051
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,600
是啊
Yeah.

1052
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,300
你觉得他们能帮我们吗
Well, do you think they can help us?

1053
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,200
热巧克力  附送棉花糖
Hot chocolate... extra marshmallows.

1054
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,300
天  实物看着比图片里更酷
Man, that looks even cooler than it did in the picture.

1055
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,400
宝贝儿  那是因为图片上没有加特林机枪
Child, you know that's because in the picture it didn't have Gatling Guns.

1056
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,500
漂亮  我去床上喝  好吗
Nice job. I'm gonna take mine to bed, okay?

1057
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,900
好吧  宝贝儿  好梦
Okay, baby doll. sleep tight.

1058
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:23,900
谢谢
Thanks.

1059
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:24,800
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}度假中

1060
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,500
-是海扁王吗  -对呢
- Oh, kick-ass? - Mmm-hmm.

1061
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,700
你去换装  我通知他在B号安全屋碰头
You go get dressed. I'll tell him to meet us at safe house 'b'.

1062
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,700
我们回来再喝热巧克力
We'll have our hot chocolate when we get back.

1063
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,000
-好  老爸  -快去吧
- Okay, daddy. - Come on.

1064
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,600
来了
There you go.

1065
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,400
-你知道在哪儿吗  -不知道  用导航系统就行
- Do you know where that is? - No, but I'll put it in the gps.

1066
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,700
好了   出发
Right, let's go.

1067
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,200
真该死
Shit.

1068
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,500
到了
Okay, okay, okay.

1069
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:42,700
你来了  还有红旋风  两位
Well. here you are and... Red Mist. two.

1070
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,600
-见到你们我很荣幸  -我也是  先生
- Pleasure to meet you. - Good to meet you, sir.

1071
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,500
进来吧
Please, come in.

1072
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,000
你先请
After you.

1073
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,400
超杀女  打个招呼  亲爱的
Hit girl. manners, honey.

1074
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,600
嗨  我是超杀女
Hi, I'm hit girl.

1075
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,200
不
No!

1076
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,100
你他妈归我了
Your ass is mine!

1077
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,600
他和我一起的  别抓他
He's with me, he's okay.

1078
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,300
算了吧  小子  你老爸说了算  你回家去
Shut the fuck up kid. your daddy's the boss. you go home.

1079
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,200
你他妈说什么
Are you shitting me?

1080
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,600
别抓他  他和我一起的  放了他
He's fine. He's with me! Let him go!

1081
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,000
快他妈离开这鬼地方
Get outta here! Get the fuck out of here.

1082
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,900
我靠  我梦寐以求的玩意啊
Hot damn. I always wanted one of these.

1083
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,700
-你真要拿走这个吗  -当然了  亲爱的
- Are you seriously gonna take that? - Yes. come on, sweet cheeks.

1084
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,100
你要是不快点给我上车  大英雄
If you don't get your wannabe superhero ass in the car...

1085
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,000
你可就有麻烦了
...you're gonna have a lot of trouble on your hands.

1086
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,900
搞笑  我要叫老爸炒了你
That's really funny. you're so fired.

1087
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,100
海扁王
Kick-Ass...

1088
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,000
把他带走  把他弄进货车
Get him outta here, get him outta here. get him in the van.

1089
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,900
海扁王  我很抱歉
Kick-Ass, I'm sorry, I...

1090
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,200
快进去
Get in the car. get in there.

1091
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,300
你得炒了这混蛋
You better fire this asshole.

1092
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,800
无视他
Ignore him...

1093
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,400
这不是火箭筒吗
A bazooka?

1094
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,800
好吧
Okay.

1095
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,100
我们不是说好了吗  老爸  我把你要的人给你弄来
We had a fucking deal, dad, that I'll get you the guy who did it...

1096
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:19,700
你就放过海扁王  他什么都没做
...and all I'm asking is you let kick-ass go. he didn't do anything wrong.

1097
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,300
克里斯  你得替我考虑考虑
Chris, you gotta look at this from my point of view. okay?

1098
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,700
我得告诉外面的人
I gotta send a public service message to the people out there...

1099
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,755
他妈的当超级英雄不好玩儿
...that being a superhero is bad for your health.

1100
01:21:28,755 --> 01:21:30,600
而那个大个子混账
And the big motherfucker...

1101
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,000
没人知道他是谁
...nobody knows who he is.

1102
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,100
-这不公平  -人生本来就不公平  习惯就好
- That's not fair. - Life's not fair, get over it.

1103
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,200
你想把他们怎么样
What are you gonna do to them?

1104
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,800
你真想参与进来吗
You really wanna be a part of my business?

1105
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,900
是的
Yeah.

1106
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,600
那就闭上嘴  坐下看
Then sit down, shut up and watch.

1107
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,600
弗兰克  我准备好了  好好欣赏吧
Frank, we're ready. enjoy the show.

1108
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,324
-你这都能控制吗  -当然
- Are you controlling this thing? - I sure am.

1109
01:22:02,324 --> 01:22:04,200
老大哥的把戏  学着点[出自《1984》]
Big brother, watch and learn.

1110
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,300
欢迎回到[大事件]
Welcome back. breaking news,

1111
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,900
我们即将为您播出一段视屏
A worldwide web broadcast of the new york superhero

1112
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,300
自称为海扁王的纽约英雄的现场直播
Who calls himself Kick-Ass is about to be shown live.

1113
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:15,500
流言称这将是他的告别声明
Rumours have it this will be his farewell appearance...

1114
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,100
他要公开表示  自己将不再打击罪恶
...that he will announce his retirement from crime fighting...

1115
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,900
据网络供应商预测
...but as word of mouth spreads internet providers are predicting that...

1116
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,600
这将是有史以来观看率最高的一段视频
...it could be one of the most widely viewed live events in web history.

1117
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:27,300
戴夫呢
Where's Dave?

1118
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,300
没有任何迹象表明这段视频的真实内容
There are no clues as yet as to the exact nature of the broadcast...

1119
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:33,200
-见鬼  你们都没注意到吗  -这还用说  他和凯蒂在一起
- Holy shit, have you guys noticed... - He's with Katie, obviously.

1120
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,000
不然我怎么会在这儿
Why else would I be here?

1121
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,600
虽然不知道视频背后的真相
There's no idea who is behind the broadcast of this show...

1122
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,600
但网络服务器已经爆棚
...but we could see widespread server crashes...

1123
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,100
戴夫  你为什么没告诉我
Dave, why didn't you tell me this is what you were doing?

1124
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,300
你上新闻了  打给我
You're on the news. Call me.

1125
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,600
让我们进入直播倒计时
We go live to the countdown clock as we are moments away.

1126
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,000
好戏开演了
Showtime.

1127
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,300
女士们先生们  大家好
Hello, boys and girls. now this...

1128
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,200
这位大家都认识了
...well, you know who this guy is.

1129
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,500
而这位是大老爸
And this guy here is Big Daddy.

1130
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,400
这些是我的朋友   伙计们  来打个招呼
And these are my friends. come on in, guys, say hello.

1131
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,100
没错  这就对了
Yeah. yeah, there they are. hello, hello.

1132
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,800
现在  大老爸和海扁王会帮助我们
Now, big daddy and kick-ass are gonna help us...

1133
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,700
告诉大家  做超级英雄可不是什么好主意
...show you why being a hero is a bad idea.

1134
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,900
你知道什是K字不发音吗
You know what a silent 'K' is?

1135
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,309
就是单词由字母K打头
That's when 'k' is at the beginning

1136
01:23:36,309 --> 01:23:38,000
但K却不发音
Of the word but you don't pronounce it...

1137
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,900
比如这个词  指节铜套  让他们看看  伙计
...like in the word 'knuckle-duster'. show them what it can do, guy.

1138
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,700
那肯定很痛  再从那边打一拳
That must've hurt. let's see it from the other side.

1139
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,400
我想大家都看到了  法语里的棍子
I think it did. now in France they say the word "stick" like this.

1140
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,600
其实是指指挥棒
Baton.

1141
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,800
我们就给海扁王来上一棍  来吧
We got some of kick-ass's batons. we're gonna show you what they can do.

1142
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,000
来吧  伙计们
Go ahead, boys.

1143
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:05,000
但在美国  我们提到棍子  都想到棒球棍
You know, in america we say "stick" like this. baseball bat.

1144
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,800
这玩意打起肚子和膝盖来可是相当好用
Which is very good for hitting knees and stomachs.

1145
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,500
打蛋蛋也一样好用哟
It's also good for hitting balls.

1146
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,000
一个个来太麻烦了
We don't do them individually...

1147
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,300
一起上吧
...we do them all together.

1148
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,000
来吧  先生们
Gentlemen, please.

1149
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,000
看起来真痛苦
Oh, this looks very painful.

1150
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,800
由于画面内容过于暴力
Due to the distressing nature of the images...

1151
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,500
我们无法再继续直播这段网络视频
...we are unable to broadcast the events streaming live on the internet.

1152
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,000
我操
Fuck.

1153
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,100
不不不
No, no...

1154
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,100
虽然早期猜测这是恶作剧或是作秀
Despite initial speculation that this may be some kind of hoax...

1155
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,600
但显然现在人质处于真正的危险之中
...or publicity stunt, it is now clear the hostages are in genuine danger.

1156
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,782
所有迹象表明  几分钟后
That all signs point to the intention to

1157
01:24:45,782 --> 01:24:48,400
将会上演一场现场处决
Stage a live execution in the next few minutes.

1158
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:05,600
就算会丢尽面子
Even with my metal plates and my fucked-up nerve endings...

1159
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,900
不得不说  真的痛死了
...I gotta tell you... that hurt.

1160
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,000
煤油  杀人于无声
Kerosene. yes, the silent killer.

1161
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,800
但这些  远比不上要丢下那些人来的痛苦
But not half as much as the idea of leaving everything behind.

1162
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,300
凯蒂
Katie.

1163
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,100
我爸爸
My dad.

1164
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,000
陶德和小马
Todd and Marty.

1165
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,500
我还有很多事没做
And all the things I'd never do.

1166
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,100
比如学开车
Like learn to drive.

1167
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,800
和凯蒂结婚生子
Or see what me and Katie's kids would look like.

1168
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,800
-看"迷失"的大结局  -真刺激
- or find out what happened on 'Lost'. - Spicy, spicy.

1169
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,323
你要是以为我肯定活下来了
And if you think I'm gonna make it

1170
01:25:36,323 --> 01:25:39,000
不然怎么现在和你讲故事呢
Through this since I'm talking to you now...

1171
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,900
别自作聪明了
...quit being such a smartass.

1172
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,000
见鬼  伙计  你没看过《罪恶都市》
Hell, dude, you never seen 'sin city'...

1173
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,200
《日落大道》和《美国丽人》吗[主角都翘了]
...'Sunset Boulevard', 'American Beauty'?

1174
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,900
而这个
And this...

1175
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,100
你们这帮乡巴佬给我看好了
...for all you cavemen out there...

1176
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,000
是火
...is fire.

1177
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,600
不
No.

1178
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,100
火可是好东西
Fire. fire is good.

1179
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,900
火是我们的朋友
Fire is our friend.

1180
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,900
好吧
Oh, yeah.

1181
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,600
先生们
Gentlemen...

1182
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,300
是时候上路了
...time to die.

1183
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,200
搞什么
What the...?

1184
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
-什么情况  -谁开个灯
- What the fuck just happened? - Hey, hey, somebody find the lights.

1185
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,600
快找打火机
Get the lighter!

1186
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,700
就在地上  快找打火机
It's on the floor right over there. find the lighter.

1187
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:40,700
找到了
I got it.

1188
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,400
不
No!

1189
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,400
快找掩护  孩子
Take cover, child!

1190
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:07,000
快拿出氪石
Now switch to kryptonite!

1191
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,300
氪石  没错
Kryptonite. yeah.

1192
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:42,800
罗宾的复仇里的招式
Go to Robin's Revenge!

1193
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,900
罗宾  罗宾...
Robin. Robin, Robin...

1194
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,100
死期到了  混账东西
Show's over, motherfuckers.

1195
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,400
我想我爱上他了  伙计
I think I'm in love with her, dude.

1196
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,200
她看上去只有11岁左右  但是...
She looks like she's about 11 years old, but...

1197
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,700
我可以等  我可以为她守贞洁誓
I can wait. I solemnly vow to save myself for her.

1198
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,600
这对你来说太难了  你没事吧
That should be really difficult for you. are you okay?

1199
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,100
没事
Yeah.

1200
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,300
干得漂亮
Good job.

1201
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,200
我太为你骄傲了  宝贝儿
I'm so proud of you, baby doll.

1202
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,200
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1203
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,500
没事
Yeah.

1204
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,900
被枪打中的感觉  比你那次要痛得多  爸爸
But getting shot, daddy, it hurt a lot more than when you did it.

1205
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,300
因为我用了低速子弹  孩子
That's because I used low velocity rounds, child.

1206
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,200
你是世界上最好的爸爸
You're the kindest daddy in the whole world.

1207
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,800
不  我只是...
No, I just...

1208
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,300
我爱你
... love you.

1209
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,300
我也爱你  爸爸
I love you, too, daddy.

1210
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,600
我也爱你  爸爸
I love you, too, daddy.

1211
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,400
安睡吧
Sleep tight.

1212
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,100
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

1213
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,800
我是说  你的真名
I mean your real name.

1214
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,900
超级英雄从不透露自己的真实身份
A superhero never reveals his true identity.

1215
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:43,600
什么  听着  你不能继续下去
What? look, you can't go on...

1216
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,500
不管你之前是什么生活
However you lived before...

1217
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,200
一切都结束了
...it's over.

1218
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,300
你还有其他亲人吗
Is there anybody else? Any family or...?

1219
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,200
听着  我能照顾好自己
Look, I can take care of myself.

1220
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:02,600
我还救了你的小命
I saved your sorry ass.

1221
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,200
那钱呢  你得从长远考虑
What about money? you gotta think long term.

1222
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,900
包里还有3百万美元
I've got 3 million dollars in a suitcase.

1223
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:13,400
够长远了吧
That long term enough for you?

1224
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
这不是钱的问题
It's not all about the money.

1225
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,000
我欠你的
I owe you.

1226
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,800
要不是你  我早死了
If it wasn't for you I'd be dead.

1227
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,500
要不是你
And if it wasn't for you...

1228
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,100
我爸也不会死
...my dad wouldn't be.

1229
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,400
听着
Look...

1230
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,800
你收拾好东西  接着去我家
...pack up whatever you need and we'll go back to my place.

1231
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,800
我要去洗下脸
I just need to clean my face.

1232
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,000
去吧
Just go.

1233
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,400
我是说收拾些睡衣  衣服什么的
I meant like pyjamas and clothes and stuff.

1234
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,200
你不能带这些玩意去我家
You can't take that stuff to my house.

1235
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,100
你知道我爸真正期望什么吗
You know what my dad really would have wanted?

1236
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,600
他希望我完成我们的未尽之事
He would have wanted me to finish what we started.

1237
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,600
我正打算这么干
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1238
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,100
这是弗兰克·达米科的家吗
Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

1239
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,300
这么多保安
All that security.

1240
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,200
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

1241
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,800
我妈妈已经白白地死去
My mom already died for nothing.

1242
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,600
我绝不想让我爸也死得不明不白
So I'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing, too.

1243
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
你不能一个人去
You can't do this on your own.

1244
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,300
当然
Exactly.

1245
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,900
你想还我老爸的人情吗
Do you wanna deal with owing my dad?

1246
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:59,500
那就闭上嘴  拿起武器
Then shut the hell up and pick your weapon.

1247
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,100
该不会刚好是我想的那样吧
Is that what I think it is?

1248
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:16,000
对极了  你最好看下说明书
Damn straight. you better start reading the instructions because...

1249
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,700
因为五分钟后你就要用上这玩意了
...you're gonna be using it in about 5 minutes.

1250
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,400
听好了  五分钟后  所有人各就各位
Listen up, we got 5 minutes and I want you back on your post.

1251
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,400
可别搞砸了
And don't leave a mess.

1252
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,900
-一切顺利吧  -一切顺利  老大
- Everything okay? - Everything's all right, boss.

1253
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,600
难以置信  我居然拿回手枪了  看啊
I can't believe I got my gun back. look at that.

1254
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,200
知道吗  这不是...
You know, it's not the...

1255
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,000
让她进来
Well, let her in.

1256
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,900
她只是个孩子  你有毛病吗
It's a little kid. what's the matter with you?

1257
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,100
你没事吧  宝贝儿
Are you okay, sweetheart?

1258
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,600
我没了妈妈爸爸
I... I lost my mommy and daddy.

1259
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:19,000
她没了爸爸妈妈
She lost her mommy and daddy.

1260
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:21,600
你要用我的手机吗
You wanna use my cell phone?

1261
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,600
你记得号码吗
Now can you remember the number?

1262
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,400
我当过真正的超级英雄吗
Had I ever been a real superhero?

1263
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,800
我只是向世界展示了这种意图
The most I'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions...

1264
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,500
并激发了一点责任感
...and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking.

1265
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:23,900
没有力量就没有责任感
With no power comes no responsibility.

1266
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,100
事实证明
Except...

1267
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:28,500
这其实错了
...that wasn't true.

1268
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,200
-真他妈的  -老大  快隐蔽
- Holy shit. - Boss, take cover, please.

1269
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:16,500
我才不在意我的名声如何
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation

1270
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,200
时代早变了  你已经过时
You're living in the past it's a new generation

1271
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,700
女孩也能为所欲为  没错  这就是我
A girl can do what she wants to do and that's what I'm gonna do

1272
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:30,900
我才不在意我的名声败坏
An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

1273
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:36,100
不是我
Not me

1274
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,700
不是我
Not me

1275
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,500
见鬼去
God damn!

1276
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,900
见鬼
Shit!

1277
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,200
搞什么
What the fuck?

1278
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,300
过来  帮帮我  伙计们
Get in here! help me out man!

1279
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,900
奶奶地  都死光了
Holy fuck... everybody's dead!

1280
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,800
她在柜台后面  她没子弹了
She's behind the counter. she's out of ammo, okay.

1281
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,400
你觉得他们搞定他了吗
Do you think they caught him?

1282
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,500
要是没搞定  还有他呢
If they didn't, he will.

1283
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,700
-出去收拾他  -现在吗
- Get out there. - Now?

1284
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,200
对
Yeah, now.

1285
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,500
他妈的怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

1286
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,400
她被困住了  没有武器
We got her trapped. she's unarmed.

1287
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,400
那你们他妈的还等什么
So what the hell are you guys waiting for?

1288
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:58,100
-去干掉她  -去啊  伙计  快去
- Go get her. - Go on, man. go get her!

1289
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:00,700
我他妈的又没有枪  我才不去
I ain't got no fucking gun. I'm not going in.

1290
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,900
枪给你
You do now.

1291
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,200
快去
Now move!

1292
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,800
快去
Go on.

1293
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:29,500
我操他妈的  我去拿火箭筒
Fuck this shit. I'm getting the bazooka.

1294
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:33,200
火箭筒
Bazooka?

1295
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,000
火箭筒
Bazooka?

1296
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,800
是我  老大  我们掌控了局面
It's only me, boss. everything's under control.

1297
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,500
掌控个屁  不然你拿火箭筒干嘛
Un... under control? you're grabbing a fucking bazooka, you dumb ass.

1298
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,000
先生
Sir?

1299
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:00,900
去吧
Do it.

1300
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,500
我想说这台词很久了
I always wanted to say this...

1301
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:29,500
向我们的小萝莉问好
...say hello to my little friend!

1302
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:57,700
荣耀无限  哈利路亚
Glory, glory, hallelujah

1303
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,600
-至高真理  -你们这帮人渣
- His truth is... - Dirty motherfuckers!

1304
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:08,600
光明前行
...marching on

1305
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:22,200
至高真理  光明前行
His truth is marching on

1306
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,700
真他妈的
Holy shit!

1307
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,300
那声音听着不太像火箭筒嘛
That is one weird sounding bazooka.

1308
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,300
司徒
Stu!

1309
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,200
我操
Fuck!

1310
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,400
搞定他们
Get them!

1311
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,600
游戏结束了  小鬼
Playtime's over, kid.

1312
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:14,000
我可不是闹着玩
I never play.

1313
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,000
是吗
Oh, really?

1314
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,100
胆敢搅了我的生意
Ruin my business, huh?

1315
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:40,500
还杀了所有我手下的人
Kill every single fucking guy on my payroll.

1316
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,800
老天  你要是我儿子多好
God, I wish I had a son like you.

1317
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,200
去九泉之下会你老爸吧
Time for a family reunion.

1318
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:23,800
喂
Hey.

1319
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,900
何不对付一个和你体型一样大的
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?

1320
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:49,000
-你没事吧  -没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

1321
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:51,900
回家吧
Time to go home.

1322
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,300
谢谢  海扁王
Thanks, Kick-Ass.

1323
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,100
我爸爸
My daddy...

1324
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:37,000
他会为我们俩感到自豪的
...he would have been proud of both of us.

1325
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,300
叫我戴夫
Dave.

1326
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,800
-戴夫·莱泽斯基  -这我知道  傻蛋
- Dave Lizewski. - I know that, dumb ass.

1327
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,000
敏蒂
Mindy.

1328
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,200
敏蒂·麦克雷迪
Mindy MacReady.

1329
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,200
-再见  -回见
- Bye-bye. - Bye.

1330
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:32,500
敏蒂搬去和马库斯住  他把她转来了我的学校
Mindy moved in with Marcus and he enrolled her at my school.

1331
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:33,800
-回见  -好运
- Bye. - Good luck.

1332
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,750
她第一次上学
First school she'd ever been to...

1333
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,900
我保证会照顾好她
On the promise that I'd look out for her.

1334
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,200
嘿
Hey.

1335
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,900
但她貌似不怎么需要我照顾
Not that she needed me to.

1336
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,100
喂  新来的
Hey, new kid.

1337
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,600
你好
Hi.

1338
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,700
快把午饭钱交出来
Lunch money... now.

1339
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,800
海扁王消失了  但人们没有忘记他
Kick-Ass was gone but not forgotten.

1340
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,500
有了这些新超级英雄的保护  我们的世界更安全了
And my world was much safer with all the new superheroes.

1341
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:07,800
大家都说是我激发了他们
They said I was their inspiration...

1342
01:50:08,106 --> 01:50:10,032
但我只是开了一扇门
But all I did was make a door into a

1343
01:50:10,032 --> 01:50:12,600
走进了童年来一直梦想的世界
World I dreamed about since I was a little kid.

1344
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:16,100
一个充满超级英雄的世界哈
A world full of superheroes, huh?

1345
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,300
一个伟人曾说过
As a great man once said...

1346
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,700
有邪恶才有正义
..."wait till they get a load of me".

1347
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,000
来吧  我已重生
Take me, I'm alive

1348
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,200
邪恶使坏的女孩  现已不再
Never was a girl with a wicked mind

1349
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:52,500
然而太阳下山  一切豁然开朗
But everything looks better when the sun goes down

1350
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:54,900
我曾拥有一切
I had everything

1351
01:50:54,900 --> 01:51:01,600
永恒的生命  暗夜的精灵
Opportunities for eternity and I could belong to the night

1352
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,800
在你的双眸深处
I see your eyes

1353
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:10,200
我仿佛能够看透
I can see in your eyes, your eyes

1354
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:13,300
你让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1355
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,700
我从未尽心全力
I'll never be good enough

1356
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:18,300
你让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1357
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:23,200
你所挚爱的一切  都将在光明中燃尽
And everything you love will burn up in the light

1358
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:29,100
每一次  我注视你的双眸
Every time I look inside your eyes

1359
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,900
你都让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1360
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,400
来吧  嗜尽我的灵魂
Taste me, drink my soul

1361
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,800
在一轮新月下  向我展现
Show me all the things that I shouldn't

1362
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,200
那藏在黑暗中的禁忌之物
Know when there's a new moon on the rise

1363
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:54,300
我曾拥有一切
I had everything

1364
01:51:54,300 --> 01:52:01,200
永恒的生命  暗夜的精灵
Opportunities for eternity and I could belong to the night

1365
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,000
在你的双眸深处
I see your eyes

1366
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:09,200
我仿佛能够看透
I can see in your eyes, your eyes

1367
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:14,600
看透那双眸深处
Everything in your eyes, your eyes

1368
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,500
你让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1369
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:20,100
我从未尽心全力
I'll never be good enough

1370
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:22,700
你让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1371
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:27,500
你所挚爱的一切  都将在光明中燃尽
And everything you love will burn up in the light

1372
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:33,400
每一次  我注视你的双眸
And every time I look inside your eyes

1373
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:38,000
你都让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1374
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:52,600
我愿意为你而死
I would die for you, my love

1375
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,800
我的爱
My love

1376
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:57,500
你让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1377
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:02,500
我愿意为你而死
And I would die for you, my love

1378
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,800
我的爱
My love

1379
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,300
我们将一同在光明中燃尽
We'll burn up in the light

1380
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:12,200
每一次  我注视你的双眸
Every time I look inside your eyes

1381
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,000
我都在扑向光明的火焰
I'm running in the light

1382
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,200
我注视你的双眸
Look inside your eyes

1383
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,800
我都在扑向光明的火焰
I'm running in the light

1384
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,200
看透那双眸深处
Look inside your eyes

1385
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:26,900
你让我生不如死
You make me wanna die

1386
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,000
我们年少轻狂
We are young

我们精力旺盛
We are strong

我们不求归宿
We're not looking for where we belong

1389
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,900
我们并不抢眼
We're not cool

1390
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:04,000
却是无比自由
We are free

1391
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,100
我们流血  我们不屈
And we're running with blood on our knees

1392
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:18,800
我们能够统治世界
We could rule the world

1393
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,700
就在一个银盘之上
On a silver platter

1394
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:22,600
就让一切重回正轨
From the wrong to the right line

1395
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:24,500
打开闸门奔流而出
To the open stream

1396
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,300
玉石俱焚
With a crash and burn

1397
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,300
改变现状
We can make it better

1398
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:30,300
颠倒是非
Turn it upside down

1399
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,500
就你和我
Just you and me

1400
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,600
我们有梦
We are the dream

1401
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:38,500
无路可退
No other way to be

1402

1408
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,200
我们能够改变世界
I could change the world

1409
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:59,100
能让一切更加美好
I can make it better

1410
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,000
翻天覆地
Kick it up and down

1411
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,900
相信我吧
Take a chance on me

1412
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,700
假笑盈盈
With your fake smile

1413
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,800
你觉得你做得更棒
And you think you're better

1414
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,700
想就这么放弃
Gonna put it down

1415
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,800
受人屈膝敬拜
Put it at your feet

1416
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
无桥可烧
No bridge to burn

1417
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,800
无路可走
Nowhere to turn for me

1418
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,700
我们年少轻狂
We are young

1430
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,500
他们了解我们吗
What do they know about us

1431
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:55,600
还是误以为是其他人
Are they thinking of somebody else

1432
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:59,100
他们知道我们吗
Are they wondering what we might be

1433
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:02,900
有想过是你还是我吗
