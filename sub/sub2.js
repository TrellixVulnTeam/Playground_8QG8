00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,330
面试

4
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,070
你好 我和尤尔曼先生有约
Hi. I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.

5
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,160
我的名字是杰克·特朗斯
My name is Jack Torrance.

6
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,950
他的办公室在一楼的左边
His office is the first door on the left.

7
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,330
谢谢
Thank you.

8
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,520
尤尔曼先生?
Mr. Ullman?

9
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,020
我是杰克·特朗斯
I'm Jack Torrance.

10
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,230
快进来 杰克
Come on in, Jack.

11
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,820
- 非常高兴见到你 - 我也是
- Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

12
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,610
这是我的秘书 苏西
This is my secretary, Susie.

13
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,490
- 苏西 你好 - 我们这儿很难找吧?
- Susie, how do you do? - Any trouble finding us?

14
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,490
不难找 到这儿我才花了三个半小时
No problem at all. I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

15
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,660
算是非常顺利了
That's very good time.

16
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,580
请稍坐一会 杰克
Sit down a minute, Jack.

17
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,590
随意 不要拘束
Just make yourself at home.

18
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
要来点咖啡吗?
Like some coffee?

19
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,760
方便的话 我想尝一尝 谢谢
If you're having some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

20
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,880
- 苏西 - 好的 先生
- Susie. - Sure.

21
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,840
顺便请比尔·华生过来
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

22
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,600
好的
Yes, I will.

23
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,570
妈妈
Mom?

24
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,570
什么?
Yeah?

25
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,570
你真打算 整个冬天都住那个旅馆吗?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?

26
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,540
当然我愿意
Sure I do.

27
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,700
那一定会很有趣
It'll be lots of fun.

28
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,710
嗯 我也这么认为
Yeah. I guess so.

29
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,090
不过 那儿恐怕没有人可以陪我玩
Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.

30
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,530
我知道 交新朋友总要花些时间的
I know. lt always takes a little time to make new friends.

31
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,270
嗯 恐怕是
Yeah, I guess so.

32
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,020
托尼怎样想呢?
What about Tony?

33
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,560
他很期待去住那个旅馆 我敢打赌
He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.

34
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,610
错 我并不期待 特朗斯太太
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

35
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,320
好了 托尼 不要淘气
Now, come on, Tony. Don't be silly.

36
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,740
我不想去那个地方
I don't want to go there.

37
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
你为什么不想去呢?
How come you don't want to go?

38
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,450
只是不想而已
I just don't.

39
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,180
那我们走着瞧
Let's just wait and see.

40
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,150
我相信我们会有个愉快的冬天
We're all going to have a real good time.

41
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,490
比尔 这位是杰克·特朗斯
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.

42
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,130
你好 比尔
How do you do, Bill?

43
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,300
- 非常高兴认识你 - 很荣幸
- Nice to meet you. - Pleasure to meet you.

44
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,430
找个位子坐 比尔 我们开始吧
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

45
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,770
杰克准备为我们 在这个冬天照顾遥望旅馆
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.

46
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,980
等我们这边告个段落 你就带他去逛逛
I'd like you to take him around soon as we're through.

47
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,110
好的
Fine.

48
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,650
杰克是位老师
Jack is a schoolteacher.

49
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,880
以前是位老师
Formerly a schoolteacher.

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,780
那你现在干什么?
What line of work are you in now?

51
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,580
写作
I'm a writer.

52
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,450
光靠教书 收支还是平衡不了
Teaching's been more or less a way of making ends meet.

53
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,630
对你而言 这是很大的转变吧?
This ought to be quite a change for you.

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,360
我正是在寻求转变
I'm looking for a change.

55
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,160
我们在丹佛的人都强烈推荐杰克 而且我立刻就...
Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and for once...

56
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,960
赞成了他们的意见
...I agree with them.

57
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,400
那好 我们讲到哪里了?
Let's see, where were we?

58
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,200
我正打算解说...
I was about to explain...

59
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,810
我们是在5月15号到10月30号营业
...that our season here runs from May 15th to October 30th.

60
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,270
然后我们会歇业 直到下个5月来临
Then we close down completely until the following May.

61
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,290
我可以问问是为什么吗?
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

62
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,950
就我所见 在这边滑雪将是非常美妙的事
It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.

63
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,760
那是肯定的 但是 问题在于庞大的开销...
It would be. The problem is the enormous cost...

64
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,530
为此我们必须保持道路通畅
...it would be to keep the road to Sidewinder open.

65
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,900
而道路绵延25英哩
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

66
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,270
到了冬天 积雪会厚达20英尺
It gets 20 feet of snow during the winter.

67
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,910
要保持道路通畅的话...
There's just no way to make it economically feasible...

68
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,050
实在是没有什么经济效益
...to keep it clear.

69
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,810
自1907年这个地方被修建以来...
When the place was built in 1907...

70
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,380
很少有人对这儿的冬季运动感兴趣的
...there was very little interest in winter sports.

71
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,460
这个地方是因为它的 与世俗隔绝和风光明媚而闻名
This site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.

72
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,220
当然 不只如此而已
It's certainly got plenty of that.

73
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,620
不错
That's right.

74
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,860
丹佛的人有没有告诉过你...
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

75
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,530
关于这个工作的负担?
...about what the job entails?

76
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,070
只说了个大概
Only in a very general way.

77
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,050
冬季总是难以想像的酷寒
The winters can be fantastically cruel.

78
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,640
工作内容是维修工作 防止带来重大损失...
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...

79
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,850
和其它一些相关的事
...and depreciation which can occur.

80
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,520
其实主要就是要照顾锅炉...
This consists mainly of running the boiler...

81
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,690
每天都要加热 保持旅馆各个角落的温暖...
...heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis...

82
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,570
如果有损坏发生就要修复...
...repairing damage as it occurs...

83
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,660
持续维护使损坏无法产生
...and doing repairs so the elements can't get a foothold.

84
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,990
这对我而言是没有问题的
That sounds fine to me.

85
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,290
其实上这工作 真的没有什么太高的要求
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.

86
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,630
在这里 冬季唯一真正要克服的...
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...

87
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,510
是巨大的被隔离感
...is a tremendous sense of isolation.

88
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,260
那正好是我要寻求的东西
That just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.

89
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,770
我正构思一部新的作品
I'm outlining a new writing project.

90
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,440
五个月的安静生活 正符合我所需
Five months of peace is just what I want.

91
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,980
很好 杰克
That's very good, Jack.

92
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,400
你知道 对某些人...
Because, for some people...

93
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,360
...孤独...
...solitude...

94
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,160
...和隔离...
...and isolation...

95
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,290
...会是一个很大的问题
...can, of itself, become a problem.

96
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,790
对我而言不是
Not for me.

97
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,460
那你的妻子和儿子呢? 你认为他们没问题吧?
How about your wife and son? Do you think they'll take to it?

98
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,380
他们会喜欢的
They'll love it.

99
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,880
很好
Great.

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,970
在我把你交给比尔以前...
Before I turn you over to Bill...

101
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,640
我想我还有一件事 不得不和你讲
...there's one other thing I think we should talk about.

102
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,350
不是吓唬人...
Not to sound melodramatic...

103
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,110
不过 这的确会让某些人
...but it's been known to give a few people...

104
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,520
重新考虑能否接受这个工作
...second thoughts about the job.

105
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,860
我很感兴趣
I'm intrigued.

106
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,410
我认为 丹佛的人一定没有提到这个...
I don't suppose they said anything in Denver...

107
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,580
1970年在这儿发生的悲剧
...about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.

108
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,160
他们的确没有
I don't believe they did.

109
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,460
我的前任...
My predecessor in this job...

110
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,470
雇佣了一个叫查尔斯·格瑞第 担任冬季看管员的工作
...hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.

111
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,140
他带着妻子和两个女儿 一个8一个10岁左右
He came up with his wife and 2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

112
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,390
他有着良好的工作记录和介绍人
He had a good employment record, good references.

113
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,850
就我刚才所言 他似乎...
And from what I've been told, he seemed...

114
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,730
就像一个安全正常的人一样
...like a completely normal individual.

115
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,320
但是冬季的某天...
But at some point during the winter...

116
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,200
他肯定受到了巨大的精神折磨
...he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.

117
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,740
然后疯狂地...
He ran amuck...

118
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,530
用斧头 杀了全家人
...and killed his family with an ax.

119
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,250
尸体全堆到西翼的一个房间里...
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...

120
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,760
来福枪装了两发子弹 含在嘴里击发
...he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.

121
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,800
警察认为...
The police thought...

122
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,060
那就是以前所谓的幽闭恐慌症
...that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin fever.

123
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,310
一种幽闭式的反应 发生在...
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...

124
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,690
人被封闭在一起 经过一段相当长时间后
...when people are shut in together over long periods of time.

125
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,120
这个故事...
That is...

126
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,870
实在很刺激
...quite a story.

127
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,660
是的
Yeah, it is.

128
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,130
到现在我还是无法相信 它就发生在这个地方 就是这儿
It's still hard for me to believe it actually happened here.

129
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,090
但是 它的确是
But it did.

130
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,890
我相信你能理解 我为什么要告诉你这些
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.

131
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,930
我当然可以
I certainly can.

132
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,020
我还可以理解 为什么丹佛的人...
I also understand why your people in Denver...

133
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,480
留着这件事 让你来告诉我
...left it for you to tell me.

134
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,360
显然 一些人会退缩...
Obviously, some people can be put off...

135
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,660
不愿意待在发生过这种事的地方
...from staying in a place where something like that happened.

136
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,740
你可以放心 这不会发生在我身上
You can rest assured that's not going to happen with me.

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,630
至于我的妻子...
And as far as my wife is concerned...

138
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,710
我确定告诉她以后 她一定会很着迷
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her.

139
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,720
她是个忠实的鬼故事迷...
She's a confirmed ghost story...

140
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,340
...和恐怖片迷
...and horror film addict.

141
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,140
托尼 你认为爸爸会得到那份工作吗?
Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?

142
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,770
他已经得到了
He already did.

143
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,900
他马上就会打电话告诉温蒂
He's going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.

144
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,290
- 嗨 宝贝 - 嗨 亲爱的 事情进行得怎样?
- Hi, babe. - Hi, hon. How's it going?

145
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,050
很好 我还在旅馆里 而且还有许多地方还没去看过
Great. I'm at the hotel and I still have a lot to do.

146
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,380
我认为9点或10点前 我可能到不了家
I don't think I can get home before 9 or 10.

147
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,090
听起来你得到这份工作了
Sounds like you got the job.

148
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,020
嗯 这儿真是个漂亮的地方
Right. It's a beautiful place.

149
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,350
你和丹尼会喜欢上它的
You and Danny are going to love it.

150
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,770
托尼 你为什么不想去那个旅馆?
Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel?

151
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,730
我不知道
I don't know.

152
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,360
你知道的 好了 告诉我吧
You do too know. Now come on, tell me.

153
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,030
不要 我不想告诉你
I don't want to.

154
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,990
求求你
Please.

155
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,330
不要
No.

156
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,750
好了 托尼 告诉我吧
Now, Tony, tell me.

157
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,040
现在睁开眼睛 我来检查
Now, hold your eyes still so I can see.

158
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,750
很好 另一只眼睛
That's good. Now the other one.

159
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,620
乖孩子
Good boy.

160
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,330
好的 丹尼...
Now, Danny...

161
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,830
在你刷牙的时候
...when you were brushing your teeth...

162
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,030
你记得你闻到一些怪味
...do you remember if you smelled anything funny...

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,010
或者看见闪光 和其它一些怪东西吗?
...or saw any bright, flashing lights or anything at all strange?

164
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,010
没有
No.

165
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,580
那你记得你在刷牙么?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?

166
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,460
是的
Yes.

167
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,220
那么 刷牙之后呢? 你记得发生过什么事情吗?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?

168
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,070
妈妈对我说 "醒醒 丹尼 醒醒"
My mom was saying, "Wake up. Wake up, Danny, wake up."

169
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,510
那你能否记得在刷牙前...
Can you remember what you were doing...

170
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,650
你在做些什么吗?
...just before you started brushing your teeth?

171
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,920
和托尼说话
Talking to Tony.

172
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,960
托尼是你的宠物之一吗?
Is Tony one of your animals?

173
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,760
不是 他是住在我嘴里的小男孩
No. He's a little boy that lives in my mouth.

174
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,460
托尼是他想像中的朋友
Tony's his imaginary friend.

175
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,800
假如你现在张开嘴 我能看见托尼吗?
If you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?

176
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,710
为什么不行?
Why not?

177
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,810
因为他藏起来了
Because he hides.

178
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,210
他藏在什么地方?
Where does he go?

179
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,120
我的胃里面
To my stomach.

180
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,060
托尼有要你去做过什么吗?
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?

181
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,790
我不想再谈论托尼了
I don't want to talk about Tony anymore.

182
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,870
好的
That's fine.

183
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,440
好的 丹尼
All right, Danny.

184
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,040
我要请你帮我个忙...
I'm going to ask you to do me a favor...

185
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,620
今天都乖乖地待在床上 好吗?
...and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day. Okay?

186
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,940
一定要这样吗?
Do I have to?

187
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,420
是的 我希望你这样
Yes. I'd like you to.

188
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,390
我们要去另外的房间说几句话
We're going in the other room for a few minutes and talk.

189
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,720
之后我会来看你的
I'll come back and check on you.

190
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,640
- 我们去客厅吗? - 是的
- Shall we go into the living room? - Yes.

191
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,210
- 请坐 - 谢谢
- Please. - Thank you.

192
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,460
特朗斯太太 我认为你没有什么好担心的
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.

193
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,690
我确信丹尼身体健康
I'm quite sure there's nothing physically wrong with Danny.

194
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,560
他现在看起来非常好
He seems absolutely fine now.

195
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,760
但是你还是应该检查一下
But you should've seen him.

196
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,470
我知道
I know.

197
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,370
孩子往往会吓着你
Kids can scare you to death.

198
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,450
但是相信我 那些并不算反常
But believe me, these episodes are not at all uncommon.

199
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,210
他们往往比表面看起来要好很多
And they look much worse than they are.

200
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,410
但是 他到底是怎么了?
But what was the matter with him?

201
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,720
大多数时候 发生在小孩子身上 某些事情是无法依常理解释的
Most of the time, these episodes with kids are never explained.

202
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,800
只是一些情绪上的原因 而且基本上很少再发生
They're brought on by emotional factors and rarely occur again.

203
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,570
和自我催眠很相似...
They're more akin to autohypnosis...

204
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,740
一种自我诱导的恍惚状态
...a kind of self-induced trance.

205
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,930
但是 假如再发生的话 我认为...
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

206
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,910
我们可以试着做些检查
...we can always think about having some tests done.

207
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,780
我确信你是对的
I'm sure you're right.

208
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,120
你住在博得很久了吗?
Have you been in Boulder long?

209
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,220
只有三个月左右
Only about three months.

210
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,800
我们是佛蒙得州来的 我丈夫以前在那边的学校教书
We're from Vermont. My husband was teaching school there.

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,600
丹尼想像中的朋友出现在...
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend....

212
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,870
托尼
Tony.

213
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,030
那么 托尼的情况 最早发生在你们到这儿的时候吗?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?

214
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,480
我想想...
Let's see....

215
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,750
丹尼和托尼说话...
I guess Danny started talking to Tony...

216
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,650
是在我们送他去幼儿园时开始的
...about the time we put him in nursery school.

217
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,360
他适应学校生活吗?
Did he adjust well to school?

218
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,500
他最开始并不喜欢学校
He didn't like it too much at first.

219
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,000
但是 之后他受了伤 然后我们就把他留在家里一段时间...
Then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while and....

220
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,310
这就是我最早 注意到他和托尼交谈的时候
I guess that's about when I first noticed he was talking to Tony.

221
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,710
他受了什么样的伤?
What sort of injury did he have?

222
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,540
肩膀脱臼
He dislocated his shoulder.

223
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,280
他怎么会受这样的伤?
How did he manage to do that?

224
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,780
这只是 嗯 那样的一些事 你知道的
It was just one of those things, you know.

225
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,990
完全是意外事故
Purely an accident.

226
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,760
我丈夫喝醉...
My husband had been drinking...

227
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,300
然后比往常迟三个小时回到家
...and he came home about three hours late.

228
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,170
他那天晚上 心情不太好
So he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.

229
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,680
然后丹尼把他一些教学用试卷 扔到满屋都是...
And Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room...

230
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,180
于是我丈夫就拉住他的肩膀 想让他离开那些试卷
...and my husband grabbed his arm to pull him away from them.

231
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,450
就是这样一些行为 你起码对孩子做过上百次...
It's just the sort of thing you do 100 times with a child...

232
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,680
你知道的 平常在公园或者街道上
...you know, in a park or in the street.

233
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,430
但是当时有点失控...
But on this particular occasion...

234
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,260
我丈夫用力过猛
...my husband just used too much strength...

235
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,060
然后他伤着了丹尼的肩膀
...and he injured Danny's arm.

236
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,640
无论如何 负面的事也有一些正面意义 因为他说...
Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said...

237
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,440
"温蒂 我绝对不会再犯同样的傻事
..."Wendy, I'm never going to touch another drop.

238
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,590
假如再发生的话 你可以离开我"
And if I do, you can leave me."

239
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,120
然后 他的确做到了
And he didn't.

240
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,820
他五个月没再沾过一点酒精
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

241
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,430
旅馆歇业日

242
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,040
我们肯定到了很高的地方 空气都不太一样了
We must really be high up. The air feels so different.

243
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,880
爸爸?
Dad?

244
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,430
我饿了
I'm hungry.

245
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,980
你应该吃了早餐的
You should've eaten your breakfast.

246
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,690
等我们到了旅馆就给你找些吃的
We'll get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.

247
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,570
好的 妈妈
Okay, Mom.

248
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,160
就是在这附近 多纳组织被雪给困住的吧?
Wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?

249
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,410
我认为是在更西边的地方 在山脊地带
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.

250
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,290
什么是多纳组织?
What was the Donner party?

251
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,470
他们是一个蓬车时代的殖民组织
They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.

252
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,930
某个冬天他们被雪困在山里头
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.

253
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,390
导致后来他们相互残杀当作食物 为的是让自己能够生存下来
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.

254
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,400
你的意思是他们相互吃掉别人?
You mean they ate each other up?

255
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,690
为了活命 他们不得不这样做
They had to, in order to survive.

256
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,150
杰克
Jack.

257
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,450
不要担心 妈妈
Don't worry, Mom.

258
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,910
我知道人吃人的 在电视上看过
I know all about cannibalism. I saw it on TV.

259
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,830
看 我说没什么吧
See, it's okay.

260
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,460
他在电视上都看过了
He saw it on the television.

261
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
- 飞机什么时候起飞? - 8点30分
- What time does the plane leave? - 8:30.

262
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,960
这样我们就有充足的时间 可以仔细检查每样东西
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.

263
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,130
- 再见 尤尔曼先生 - 再见
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman. - Bye.

264
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,460
早安 希望没有让你等太久
Good morning. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.

265
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,300
没关系 我们正好有足够的时间去找点吃的
No problem. We had time to grab a bite to eat.

266
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,390
很幸运 你能赶在他们关掉厨房前这样做
Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.

267
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,310
你的家人都有四处看看吗?
Is your family having a look around?

268
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,900
没有 因为我儿子发现了游戏室
No, my son's discovered the games room.

269
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,190
- 你的行李都带来了吗? - 都在这儿
- Has your luggage been brought in? - Right there.

270
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,690
预见到我们今天要做的一切...
In view of all we have to cover today...

271
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,570
我建议我们去看看你的住所 马上去
...I suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started.

272
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,580
把特朗斯先生全家的行李 搬到他们的住所去
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.

273
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,540
我最好先叫上我的家人
I'd better collect my family first.

274
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,010
这是我们的休闲室
This is our Colorado Lounge.

275
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,640
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

276
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,890
天!
My God!

277
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,640
这个地方实在太不可思议了 不是吗 亲爱的?
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

278
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,230
的确是
It sure is.

279
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,050
我从来没见过这样的东西
I've never seen anything like this before.

280
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,660
那些全部是正统印地安风格吗?
Are all these lndian designs authentic?

281
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,290
我相信它们是主要是...
I believe they're based...

282
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,690
基于纳瓦霍和阿帕契部族的风格
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

283
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,860
它们真是非常的华丽
They're really gorgeous.

284
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,090
事实上...
As a matter of fact...

285
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,390
这可能是我所见过的最华丽的旅馆了
...this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

286
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,770
这个古老的地方有一个辉煌的过去
This old place has had an illustrious past.

287
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,070
在全盛时期 乘喷射机旅行的富豪 都当这里是重要观光景点
In its heyday, it was a stopping place for the jet setters...

288
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,250
甚至在喷射客机旅行流行以前
...even before anybody knew what a jet set was.

289
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,510
这里曾经有四位总统呆过
We had four presidents who stayed here.

290
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,050
很多的影视明星
Lots of movie stars.

291
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,810
皇族呢?
Royalty?

292
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,590
所有最出色的人
All the best people.

293
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,970
这是旅馆职员的宿舍
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

294
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,260
冬天里这里以外的房间都没有暖气
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.

295
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,390
- 再见 尤尔曼先生 - 再见 姑娘们
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman. - Goodbye, girls.

296
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,560
这里便是你们的居室
And here are your quarters.

297
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,610
客厅 卧室 浴室
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

298
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,400
还有一间小房间 给你的儿子住
And a small bedroom for your son.

299
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,990
对孩子而言 这相当不错
Perfect for a child.

300
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,980
嗯 这里什么东西都很齐全
Well, then. Place is very nicely self-contained.

301
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,750
比较好管理
Easy to keep.

302
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,590
很舒适
Cozy.

303
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,060
是的 对一个家庭而言 非常舒适
Yes, very cozy for a family.

304
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,960
假如你们想继续的话...
If you feel like spreading out...

305
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,830
要知道 你们还得去看看其它的那些地方
...you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.

306
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,970
嗯 这里非常的...
Well, it's very...

307
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,810
有家的感觉
...homey.

308
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,980
这是我们著名的树篱迷宫
This is our famous hedge maze.

309
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,490
这是非常有吸引力的所在 墙高是13英尺
It's quite an attraction here. The walls are 13 feet high...

310
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,990
还有这些树篱 它们就像这个旅馆一样历史悠久
...and the hedge is as old as the hotel itself.

311
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,820
非常有趣 不过 我绝对不想走进去...
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't want to go in there...

312
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,030
除非我自己有把握 一个小时内能走出来
...unless I had an hour to spare to find my way out.

313
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,530
遥望旅馆是什么时候修建的?
When was the Overlook built?

314
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,770
1907年开始建造
Construction started in 1907.

315
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,950
1909年竣工
It was finished in 1909.

316
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,810
地基据说是印地安人的墓地
The site's supposed to be on an lndian burial ground.

317
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,650
这一度激怒了他们...
They actually had to repel...

318
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,750
甚至在修建过程中 遭遇过印地安人的攻击
...a few lndian attacks as they were building it.

319
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,260
这是我们的雪地车
That's our Snowcat.

320
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,990
你们两个都会开吧?
Can you both drive a car?

321
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,090
很好 一般说来 开雪地车就跟开普通车辆没两样
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

322
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,860
你不会花太多时间来掌握它的
It won't take you long to get the hang of it.

323
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,440
事实上 我们曾经从芝加哥找了个漆匠...
As a matter of fact, we brought a decorator in from Chicago...

324
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,770
就在去年 重新粉刷旅馆的这个部分
...just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.

325
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,950
他的确做的非常漂亮
He sure did a beautiful job.

326
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,480
粉红和金色是我最喜欢的色彩
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

327
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,650
这是我们的黄金舞厅
This is our Gold Ballroom.

328
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,490
哇塞!
I'll say!

329
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,460
我们可以让300人在这里舒适地聚会
We can accommodate up to 300 people here very comfortably.

330
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,860
哈 我们可以在这里开个精采的派对
Boy, we could really have a good party in this room.

331
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,870
我恐怕 在你获得补给品之前 此处也不真能让你开个好派对
I'm afraid you won't do too well here unless you brought supplies.

332
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,130
在关闭前 我们会把酒从柜台那边移走
We remove the booze from the premises when we shut down.

333
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,400
这将减低我们的保险费用
That reduces the insurance we normally have to carry.

334
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,580
我们并不喝酒
We don't drink.

335
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,220
那么 你们非常幸运
Then you're in luck.

336
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,650
迪克 过来跟特朗斯太太和先生问个好
Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

337
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,980

This is Dick Hallorann, our head chef.

338
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,920

Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack. This is my wife, Winifred.

339

很高兴认识你
Glad to meet you.

340
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,400
特朗斯一家人 将在这个冬季照顾遥望旅馆
The Torrances will take care of the Overlook this winter.

341
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,330
这很好啊 你们对我们的旅馆印象如何?
That's just great. How do you folks like our hotel so far?

342
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,400
非常棒的地方
It's just wonderful.

343

我刚好在外面遇上他 他在找你们
I found him outside looking for you.

345
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,810
你已经厌倦玩游戏了?
Did you get tired of bombing the universe?

346
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,710
到这边来
Come on over here.

347
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,080
谢谢你 苏西
Thank you, Susie.

348
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,280
你应该带特朗斯太太去看一下厨房
I think it'd be good if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

349
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,360
我和杰克可以继续逛逛
...while I continue on with Jack.

350
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,000
那是我的荣幸 请这边走
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

351
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,760
好的 一会见 亲爱的
Great. See you later, honey.

352
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,330
再见 亲爱的
Bye, darling.

353
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,040
特朗斯太太 你丈夫介绍你说名字叫温妮芙瑞德
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.

354
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,770
那么 是叫你"温妮"还是"芙瑞蒂"?
Now, are you a "Winnie", or a "Freddie"?

355
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,240
叫我温蒂
I'm a Wendy.

356
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,650
温蒂 不错 非常好的称呼
Wendy. That's nice. That's the prettiest.

357
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,480
这里就是厨房吗?
This is the kitchen, huh?

358
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,280
是的
This is it.

359
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,430
你喜欢这里吗 丹尼? 对你而言 这里够大了吗?
How do you like it, Danny? is it big enough for you?

360
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,460
这是我见过的最大的地方
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

361
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,030
这整个地方就像个巨大的迷宫
This whole place is such an enormous maze.

362
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,800
我每次进来都得撒些面包屑做标记
I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.

363
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,570
不要让它把你吓倒了
Don't let it get you down.

364
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,270
它是很大 不过无论怎样也只是间厨房而已
It's big, but it ain't nothing but a kitchen.

365
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,670
这里许多东西你都没必要去碰
A lot of this stuff you'll never have to touch.

366
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,110
如果乱碰 我将很难收拾
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.

367
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,440
有一件事是肯定的 你不要担心没有食物
One thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food.

368
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,320
足够你们在这儿吃一年 而且保证每次的菜单都不一样
You folks could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.

369
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,620
这里是我们的冷藏室
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

370
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,820

...and 20 legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc?

376
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,720
不喜欢? 那 你最喜欢的是什么食物呢?
You don't? What's your favorite food, then?

377
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,790
法国油炸食物和调味酱
French fries and ketchup.

378
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,520
我想我们也能找到那个的 多克
I think we can manage that too, Doc.

379
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,460
继续走 小心你们的脚下
Come along, now. Watch your step.

380
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,760
你怎么知道我们叫他多克?
How'd you know we call him Doc?

381
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,000
- 你什么意思? - 多克 你叫了丹尼两次"多克"
- Beg your pardon? - Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

382
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,610
我有吗?
I did?

383
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,540
我们有时叫他多克 就像卡通片 "疯狂的兔子" 里一样
We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

384
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,010
但是 你是怎么知道的呢?
But how did you know?

385
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,750
我想 我可能是听到你这么叫他了
I guess I probably heard you call him that.

386
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,220
有可能 但是我真的不记得...
It's possible. But I honestly don't remember...

387
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,620
在我们见面后我有这么叫过他
...calling him that since we've been with you.

388
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,020
无论如何 他看起来就像是多克 不是么?
Anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn't he?

389
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,900
怎么了 多克?
What's up, Doc?

390
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,930
嗯 这里是储藏室

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,380
各种小吃 甜点...
Sociables, finger rolls...

401
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,110
你想要的每种食物
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

402
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,850
嗯 我们有桃干 杏干...
Now, we've got dried peaches, dried apricots...

403
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,160
...葡萄干和李干
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

404
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,670
你知道 如果你想快乐一点 你必须要保持秩序
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.

405
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,200
- 你们进行得怎样? - 很好
- How're you getting on? - Fine.

406
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,970
能借用一下特朗斯太太吗? 我们正打算去地下室
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance? We're on our way to the basement.

407
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,110
我保证不会占用很长时间的
I promise we won't keep her very long.

408
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,510
好的 尤尔曼先生 我正打算去做冰淇淋的
No problem, Mr.Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream.

409
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,590
你喜欢冰淇淋吧 多克?
You like ice cream, Doc?

410
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,420
我认为你喜欢呢
I thought you did.

411
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,680
你们介意在等你们的这段时间 我给丹尼一些冰淇淋么?
You folks mind if I give Danny some ice cream while we wait?

412
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,730
- 当然不会 - 我们不介意的
- Not at all. - We don't mind.

413
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,130
- 好的 - 听到这个你很高兴吧 多克?
- Good. - Sound good to you, Doc?

414
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,390
好吧 你们去做你们的
Okay, you behave yourself.

415
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,270
你想要哪种冰淇淋呢?
What kind of ice cream do you like?

416
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,370
巧克力
Chocolate.

417
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,550
那就是巧克力的 来吧 孩子 过来
Chocolate it shall be. Come on, son.

418
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,110
今天真是非常神奇的一天
It's amazing, all this activity today.

419
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,120
客人和部分职员昨天就走了 但是...
The guests and some staff left yesterday, but the...

420
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,760
这最后一天仍然是令人兴奋的
...last day's always hectic.

421
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,020
每个人都想尽早上路
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.

422
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,260
今晚5点后 就很难想像 这个地方有很多人在的样子
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.

423
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,530
就像艘鬼船一样 不是吗?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

424
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,180
你晓得为什么 我知道你的名字叫多克吗?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?

425
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,160
你不明白我在说什么吧?
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?

426
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,630
我记得 在我还小的时候...
I can remember when I was a little boy...

427
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,560
...我的祖母和我可以...
...my grandmother and I could hold conversations...

428
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,610
...完全不开口进行交谈
...entirely without ever opening our mouths.

429
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,980
她管这叫"闪灵"
She called it "shining."

430
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,210
一直以来 我都认为只有我和她...
And for a long time I thought it was just the two of us...

431
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,050
拥有"闪灵"
...that had "the shine" to us.

432
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,650
就像你也可能 一直认为自己有独特天赋一样
Just like you probably thought you was the only one.

433
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,200
但是 还有其他人也是一样的...
But there are other folks...

434
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,130
虽然他们大多数都没有体会到 甚至不相信
...though mostly they don't know it, or don't believe it.

435
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,240
你能这样已经多久了?
How long have you been able to do it?

436
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,850
你为什么不想谈谈它呢?
Why don't you want to talk about it?

437
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,150
我不该那样
I'm not supposed to.

438
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,260
谁说你不该那样?
Who says you ain't supposed to?

439
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
托尼
Tony.

440
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,740
谁是托尼?
Who's Tony?

441
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,610
托尼是住在我嘴里的小男孩
Tony's the little boy that lives in my mouth.

442
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,580
托尼就是那个...
Is Tony the one that...

443
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,350
告诉你古怪事情的人?
...tells you things?

444
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,260
他怎样告诉你的?
How does he tell you things?

445
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,400
我就像是睡着了一样 然后 他就给我看一些东西
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things.

446
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,700
但是 当我醒来后 我就记不起来发生了什么
But when I wake up, I can't remember everything.

447
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,240
你父母知道托尼的事吗?
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?

448
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,110
- 他们知道 - 托尼有告诉你奇怪的事情吗?
- Yes. - Do they know he tells you things?

449
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,930
不知道 托尼叫我绝对不要和他们说
No, Tony told me never to tell them.

450
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,430
托尼有告诉过你这个地方的事吗?
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?

451
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,190
关于遥望旅馆?
About the Overlook Hotel?

452
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,030
我不知道
I don't know.

453
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,740
仔细想想 多克
Now think real hard, Doc.

454
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,970
想想
Think.

455
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,820
他似乎有给我看过一些东西
Maybe he showed me something.

456
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,390
那 仔细想想是什么
Try to think of what it was.

457
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,700
哈罗朗先生 你害怕这个地方吗?
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared of this place?

458
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,030
不怕 并不害怕
No, Scared of nothing here.

459
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,000
只是...
It's just that...

460
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,580
你知道的 一些地方 似乎就像人一样
...you know, some places are like people.

461
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,110
有的很特别...
Some shine...

462
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,720
但 有的却相反
...and some don't.

463
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,080
我想遥望旅馆...
I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel...

464
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,590
它有些东西 很特别 就像闪灵一样
...has something about it that's like shining.

465
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,030
这里有发生过不好的事吗?
Is there something bad here?

466
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,080
你知道 多克 一些事发生后...
You know, Doc, when something happens...

467
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,910
它总会留下一些痕迹
...it can leave a trace of itself behind.

468
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,250
嗯 就像...
Say, like...

469
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,520
大胡子会在胡须上留下面包屑
...if someone burns toast.

470
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:57,290
但是 某些事情却留下不一样的痕迹
Maybe things that happen leave other kind of traces behind.

471
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,910
不是所有人都可以注意到的那种痕迹
Not things that anyone can notice.

472
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,910
但是 拥有闪灵的人可以看到
But things that people who shine can see.

473
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,310
就像他们能看到还没发生的事一样...
Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet...

474
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,750
在某些时候 他们能看到许久以前发生的一些事
...sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago.

475
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,160
我想 这里曾经发生过许多事...
I think a lot of things happened right here...

476
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,060
在这所特别的旅馆的悠久历史里
...in this particular hotel over the years.

477
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,000
这些事 并不全都是好事
And not all of them was good.

478
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,940
那么 237房发生过什么?
What about room 237?

479
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,480
237房?
Room 237?

480
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,880
你害怕237房 不是吗?
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?

481
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,130
不怕 我不害怕
No, I ain't.

482
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,460
哈罗朗先生 237房里面到底有些什么?
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

483
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,170
什么也没有
Nothing.

484
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,840
237房里面没有什么 根本没有!
There ain't nothing in room 237.

485
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,270
而且 你也没有必要去那个地方
But you ain't got no business going in there anyway.

486
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,610
所以 不要靠近它
So stay out.

487
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,310
明白了吗? 不要靠近它!
You understand? Stay out!

488
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,490
一个月后

489
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,430
早晨 亲爱的
Good morning, hon.

490
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
你的早餐已经做好了
Your breakfast is ready.

491
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,600
现在几点?
What time is it?

492
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,670
大概11点30分
It's about 11:30.

493
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,170
天啊
Jesus.

494
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,550
我想我们实在是睡得太晚
I guess we've been staying up too late.

495
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,290
我知道
I know it.

496
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,460
都按你喜欢的口味做的 尝尝吧
I made them just the way you like them, sunny-side up.

497
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,320
很好
Nice.

498
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,400
外面的风景真的很美
It's really pretty outside.

499
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,830
吃完早餐后 我们可以出去散步么?
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?

500
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,770
我想我得先写些东西
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.

501
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,870
有什么构思了吗?
Any ideas yet?

502
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,540
太多的构思
Lots of ideas.

503
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,270
但是都没有好的
No good ones.

504
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,220
好创意总会有的
Something will come.

505
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,660
关键是要养成每天都得写作的习惯
It's just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.

506
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,920
就是这样而已
That's all it is.

507
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,330
到这个地方来真是不错啊 不是吗?
It's really nice up here, isn't it?

508
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,170
我喜欢这儿
I love it.

509
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,260
真的喜欢
I really do.

510
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,200
我从来没有在别的地方 感觉有这么舒适和快活
I've never been this happy or comfortable anywhere.

511
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,180
你这么快就能适应这样一个大地方 真是让人惊讶
It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.

512
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,280
老实说 我们刚来的时候...
I tell you, when we first came up here...

513
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,550
我认为这里会非常可怕
...I thought it was kind of scary.

514
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,550
但是我立刻就喜欢上了这儿
I fell in love with it right away.

515
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,020
当我来这里应聘的时候...
When I came up here for my interview...

516
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,230
就感到 我似乎曾经来过这儿
...it was as though I'd been here before.

517
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,060
我的意思是 我们总会有些似曾相识的感觉...
I mean, we all have moments of deja vu...

518
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,470
但是这次有些不一样
...but this was ridiculous.

519
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,870
我几乎能知道...
It was almost as though I knew...

520
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,010
每个角落会有些什么东西存在
...what was going to be around every corner.

521
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,350
输了的人就要打扫整个美国 怎样?
The loser has to keep America clean. How's that?

522
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,120
- 好的 - 你已经要输了
- All right. - And you're going to lose.

523
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,460
我要来抓你了 你最好跑快点!
And I'm going to get you. You'd better run fast!

524
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,600
注意了!
Look out!

525
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,670
我快抓到你了
I'm coming in close.

526
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,370
输家要打扫整个美国哦
Loser has to keep America clean.

527
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,240
我要打扫整个美国
Keep America clean.

528
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,720
丹尼 你赢了
Danny, you win.

529
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,380
我们休息会吧 走走
Let's take the rest of this walking.

530
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,320
把手给我
Give me your hand.

531
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,760
这里很漂亮吧?
Isn't it beautiful?

532
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,880
死胡同
Dead end.

533
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,980
我们到了
We made it.

534
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,720
很漂亮吧?
Isn't it beautiful?

535
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,250
非常漂亮
It's so pretty.

536
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,790
我没有想到它居然这么大 你呢?
I didn't think it was going to be this big. Did you?

537
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,700
没有
No.

538
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,390
星期二

539
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,770
卢瑟福在追查一起...
Rutherford was serving a life sentence...

540
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,740
在1968年执行枪决的命案
...for a 1968 shooting.

541
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,810
对在阿斯本失踪妇女的搜索 仍然持续进行着
And the search continues for that missing Aspen woman.

542
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,380
苏珊·罗伯逊 24岁 已经失踪10天了
24-year-old Susan Robertson has been missing 10 days.

543
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,320
她在和丈夫一起的打猎途中走失
She disappeared on a hunting trip with her husband.

544
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,320
他们也许不得不取消搜索...
They may have to call off the search...

545
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,050
假如预测的暴风雪明天果真来临
...if a predicted snowstorm moves in tomorrow.

546
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,130
丹佛今天风和日丽...
It's so beautiful in Denver today...

547
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,460
很难想像一场暴风雪就要来临
...it's hard to believe a snowstorm could be close.

548
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,900
我甚至想出去沐浴阳光...
I want to go outside and lie in the sun...

549
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,230
在我们的北方和西方 天气仍然很冷 下着雪
...yet to our north, to our west, it is snowing and cold.

550
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,640
而且冷空气在移动...
And it's moving...

551
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,010
这同时 它正移向科罗拉多州 难以置信...
...right here towards Colorado as we talk. It's incredible.

552
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,990
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, honey.

553
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,990
工作进行得怎样?
How's it going?

554
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,730
还行
Fine.

555
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,390
今天写了很多吗?
Get a lot written today?

556
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,000
是的
Yes.

557
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,010
天气预报说 今晚会开始下雪
The weather forecast said it's going to snow tonight.

558
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,550
那又怎样? 你想我怎样?
What do you want me to do about it?

559
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,850
好了 亲爱的
Come on, honey.

560
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,220
不用这么不高兴吧
Don't be so grouchy.

561
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,960
我并没有...
I'm not...

562
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,530
不高兴
...being grouchy.

563
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,530
我只是想完成我的工作
I just want to finish my work.

564
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,440
好的 我明白了
Okay. I understand.

565
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,270
一会儿我给你带点三明治来
I'll come back later with a couple of sandwiches.

566
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,950
到那时候 你也许能让我看看 你已经写了些什么
Maybe you'll let me read something then.

567
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,250
温蒂...
Wendy...

568
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,050
...让我告诉你一件事
...let me explain something to you.

569
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,830
当你进来打断我的时候 意味着你破坏了我的集中力
When you come in and interrupt, you're breaking my concentration.

570
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,470
你把我的注意力转移开了...
You're distracting me...

571
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,110
我得费力气 再把注意力摆回工作上去
...and it will then take me time to get back to where I was.

572
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,740
明白了吗?
Understand?

573
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,700
明白
Yeah.

574
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,170
好的
Fine.

575
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,080
我们得定个新规矩:
We're going to make a new rule:

576
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,720
无论什么时候 只要我在这里...
Whenever I'm in here...

577
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,180
你有听到我打字的声音...
...and you hear me typing...

578
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,930
或者 无论你听到我在这里干什么
...or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...

579
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,430
只要我呆在这儿 就意味着我在工作
...when I'm in here, that means I am working.

580
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,860
也就是说 那时不能进来打扰我
That means don't come in.

581
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,330
好了 你现在明白了吗?
Now, do you think you can handle that?

582
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,100
- 嗯 - 好
- Yeah. - Fine.

583
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,440
那你怎么还不行动 给我滚出这个地方?
Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here?

584
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,820
好
Okay.

585
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,020
星期四

586
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,750
你好了吧!
All right, you!

587
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,990
你知道你手里面还有
I know you've got more.

588
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,160
没打中!
Missed!

589
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,570
现在没了!
Don't have!

590
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,530
那不怕你了
No fair anymore.

591
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,130
星期六

592
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,020
我应该早想到
I knew it.

593
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,780
这是KDK 12在呼叫KDK 1
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1.

594
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,000
KDK 12 呼叫 KDK 1
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

595
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,330
这边是KDK 1 我们收到你的呼叫了 完毕
This is KDK 1. We're receiving you. Over.

596
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:19,830
嗨 我是遥望旅馆的温蒂·特朗斯
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.

597
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,210
嗨 你们在上头过得如何? 完毕
Hi, how are you folks getting on up there? Over.

598
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,810
我们过得很好
We're just fine.

599
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,480
但是我们的电话 似乎有点问题
But our telephones aren't doing too well.

600
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:30,710
是线路断了吗? 完毕
Are the lines down, by any chance? Over.

601
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,160
是的 因为暴风雪的关系 一部分线路出问题了 完毕
Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm. Over.

602
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,660
有可能尽快修好吗? 完毕
Any chance of them being repaired soon? Over.

603
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,030
嗯 我恐怕不行
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

604
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:43,670
可能整个冬天都只能这样 得等到春天才会修理 完毕
Most winters they stay that way until spring. Over.

605
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,570
伙计 这暴风雪可真是厉害 不是吗? 完毕
Boy, this storm is really something, isn't it? Over.

606
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,940
是的 真是如此
Yes. It's one of the worst we've had for years.

607
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,710
我们还能为你做点其它的什么吗? 特朗斯太太 完毕
Is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

608
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,350
我想 没什么了 完毕
I suppose not. Over.

609
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:01,250
假如你们遇到什么麻烦 就呼叫我们
If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a call.

610
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,760
还有 特朗斯太太...
And, Mrs. Torrance?

611
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,160
你们最好一直都开着无线通话装置
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.

612
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,490
好的 我们会这样做的
Okay. We'll do that.

613
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,760
很高兴能和你交谈
It was real nice talking to you.

614
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,600
再见 挂断
Bye. Over and out.

615
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,710
你好 丹尼

618
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,770
永远...
Forever...

619
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,310
永远...
...and ever...

620
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,270
永远
...and ever.

621
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,380
托尼...
Tony...

622
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,410
我很害怕
...I'm scared.

623
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,460
记住哈罗朗先生说过的话
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

624
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,970
那就像是书里的插画一样 没什么好怕的 丹尼
It's just like pictures in a book, Danny.

625
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,330
那并不是真实的东西
It isn't real.

626
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,430
星期一

627
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,340
请让我给你些钱
Please let me give you some money.

628
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,560
不要 我想我不能接受
I wouldn't think of it.

629
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,070
好的 那你要我怎样报答你?
Well, how can I repay you?

630
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,950
不用了 真的
It's okay. Really.

631
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,680
嗯 我想喝些咖啡
Well, I'm going to have some coffee.

632
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,410
你也喝点好吗?
Would you like some?

633
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,210
好吧
Sure.

634
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,290
很好 请坐
Great. Sit down.

635
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,830
神奇炸圈饼 你自己拿罢
Marvelous doughnuts. Help yourself.

636
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,910
- 咖啡马上就好 - 妈妈
- Coffee will be ready in a few minutes. - Mom.

637
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,190
什么?
Yes.

638
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,020
我能去我的房间拿我的消防车吗?
Can I go up to my room and get my fire engine?

639
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,180
现在不行 爸爸正在睡觉呢
Not right now. Daddy's asleep.

640
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,320
我会小心不出声的
I won't make any noise.

641
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,630
嗯 多克
Now come on, Doc.

642
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,530
你爸爸才睡了一会儿
He only went to bed a few hours ago.

643
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,530
你不能再等等么?
Can't you wait till later?

644
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,870
我不会弄出声响的 我保证 我会掂脚尖走进去
I won't make a sound. I promise I'll tiptoe.

645
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,370
好吧
All right.

646
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,980
但是真的不要弄出声音
But really don't make a sound.

647
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,670
我不会的 妈妈
I won't, Mom.

648
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,210
拿到就马上回来...
Make sure you come right back...

649
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,410
因为我得马上去做午饭了
...because I'm going to make lunch soon.

650
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,050
好的 妈妈
Okay, Mom.

651
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,480
我能去我的房间拿我的消防车吗?
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?

652
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,420
到这边来
Come here for a minute first.

653
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,240
感觉怎样呢 多克?
How's it going, Doc?

654
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,140
很好
Okay.

655
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,610
过得好吗?
Having a good time?

656
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,150
是的 爸爸
Yes, Dad.

Good.

658

我希望你能过得愉快
I want you to have a good time.

659
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,990
我很愉快 爸爸
I am, Dad.

660
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,840
- 爸爸 - 什么?
- Dad. - yes?

661
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,240
你感觉不好?
Do you feel bad?

662
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:56,480
不是 只是有些累
No, I'm just a little bit tired.

663
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,620
那 你为什么不睡会呢?
Then why don't you go to sleep?

664
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,760
我不能睡
I can't.

665
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,530
因为还有很多事得做
I got too much to do.

666
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,110
你喜欢这所旅馆吗?
Do you like this hotel?

667
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,520
嗯
I do.

668
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,830
我喜欢它
I love it.

669
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,360
难道你不是吗?
Don't you?

670
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,230
我想 我也是
I guess so.

671
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,070
很好
Good.

672
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,610
我希望你能喜欢这里
I want you to like it here.

673
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,990
我希望我们能永远待在这个地方...
I wish we could stay here forever...

674
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,990
永远...
...and ever...

675
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,990
永远
...and ever.

676
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,460
什么?
What?

677
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,830
你永远都不会伤害我和妈妈 对吗?
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?

678
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,800
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

679
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,520
你妈妈对你说过些什么?
Did your mother ever say that to you?

680
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,990
说我会伤害你?

我爱你 胜过一切...
I love you more than anything else...

686
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,380
胜过世上的任何东西...
...in the whole world...

687
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,210
我永远不会伤害你的...
...and I would never do anything to hurt you...

688
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,750
永远

689
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,690

妈妈 你在吗?
Mom, are you in there?

696
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:50,790
怎么了?
What happened?

697
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,230
亲爱的...
Honey...

698
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,500
发生了什么事?
...what's wrong?

699
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,080
我作梦了...
I had the most...

700
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,880
作一个我一生中最可怕的梦

- 最最可怕的 - 好了 好了 现在没事了
- It was the most horrible dream. - It's okay, it's okay now.

702
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,320
真的?
Really.

703
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,190
我梦见...
I dreamed that I...

704
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,830
我杀了你和丹尼
...that I killed you and Danny.

705
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,800
但是 我不仅仅是杀了你们
But I didn't just kill you.

706
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,870
我还把你们切成一片一片的
I cut you up into little pieces.

707
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,070
我的天
My God.

708
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,350
我一定是疯了
I must be losing my mind.

709
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,250
一切都会没事的
Everything's going to be all right.

710
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,060
好的 让我们站起来
Come on. Let's get up off the floor.

711

坐下
There. Now sit up.

712
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,140
好的
It's okay.

713
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,680
放松
It's okay.

714
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,950
丹尼!
Danny!

715
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,190
没什么事
Everything's okay!

716
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:14,560
去你的房间玩会儿
Just go play in your room for a while.

717
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,960
你爸爸有些头痛
Your dad's just got a headache.

718
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,290
丹尼 听到我说什么了吗? 去你房间里玩
Danny, mind what I say. Go play in your room.

719
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,210
亲爱的 等我把他带走
Honey, let me just go get him out of here.

720
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:27,930
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

721
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,910
你为什么不听我的话?
Why don't you mind me?

722
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,360
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

723
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,960
你脖子上是怎么搞的?
What happened to your neck?

724
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,030
你脖子上到底是怎么回事?
What happened to your neck?

725
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,970
你对他这样的...
You did this to him...

726
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,840
不是你吗?
...didn't you?!

727
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,730
你这个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch!

728
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,810
你居然这样对他!
You did this to him!

729
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,450
你居然? !
Didn't you?!

730
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,450
你怎么可以这样? !
How could you?!

731
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,420
你怎么忍心? !
How could you?!

732
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,390
我得来点喝的 无论要我付出什么代价
God! I'd give anything for a drink.

733
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,930
即便付出我该死的灵魂...
I'd give my goddamn soul...

734
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,630
能换来一杯啤酒
...for just a glass of beer.

735
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,110
嗨 罗伊德
Hi, Lloyd.

736
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,060
今晚似乎没什么人 不是吗?
A little slow tonight, isn't it?

737
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,200
是的 特朗斯先生
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

738
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,740
想要点什么?
What will it be?

739
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:52,380
这个问题你问得好 罗伊德...
I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd...

740
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,920
因为我正好有两张20块
...because I just happen to have two twenties...

741
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,020
和两张10块的钞票摆在我口袋里
...and two tens right here in my wallet.

742
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,490
我正担心 它们会在口袋里待到下个春天呢
I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.

743
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,030
好 听着 我要的是:
So here's what:

744
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:07,630
你给我一瓶波本...
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

745
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,630
和一个装了冰块的杯子
...a little glass and some ice.

746
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,860
你能做到吧 不是吗 罗伊德?
You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?

747
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,680
你并不很忙 是吧?
You're not too busy, are you?

748
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,740
是的 先生 我一点都不忙
No, sir. I'm not busy at all.

749
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,810
好伙计
Good man.

750
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,210
你把它们摆好...
You set them up...

751
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:25,350
我会把它们各个击破
...and I'll knock them back, one by one.

752
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:29,430
白人的使命 罗伊德 我的伙计
White man's burden, Lloyd, my man.

753
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,790
白人的使命 (暗指: 击退印地安人)
White man's burden.

754
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,000
我说 罗伊德...
Say, Lloyd...

755
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,970
我好像一时有点轻飘飘了
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

756
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,740
不管怎么说 我在这边信誉如何?
How's my credit in this joint, anyway?

757
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:47,380
你的信誉很好 特朗斯先生
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

758
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,710
我可以发誓
That's swell.

759
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,610
我欣赏你 罗伊德
I like you, Lloyd.

760

我一直都欣赏你

761
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,020
你是其中最优秀的
You were always the best of them.

762
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,590
好得不能再好的吧台招待...
Best goddamned bartender...

763
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:01,730
从蒂姆布克图到缅因州的波特兰
...from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.

764
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,160
或是到俄勒冈州的波特兰 都是一样的
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.

765
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,230
谢谢夸奖
Thank you for saying so.

766
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:13,070
在货车上过了备受煎熬的5个月...
Here's to 5 miserable months on the wagon...

767
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,340
给我带来了永久的心灵创伤
...and all the irreparable harm that it's caused me.

768
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:38,040
过得还顺利吧? 特朗斯先生
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?

769
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,970
情况会好转的
Things could be better.

770
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,240
情况会整个彻底好转的
Things could be a whole lot better.

771
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,450
我希望没什么太大问题
I hope it's nothing serious.

772
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,450
没什么大问题啦
Nothing serious.

773
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:01,990
只是跟楼上的哪个老精子银行(注:温蒂) 有点小小问题
Just a little problem with...the old sperm bank upstairs.

774
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,570
但我完全可以掌握
Nothing I can't handle, though.

775
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,470
谢谢
Thanks.

776
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,930
女人
Women.

777
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,670
不能够和她们一起生活...
Can't live with them...

778
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,710
离开她们又活不下去

我绝没有碰他 妈的
I never laid a hand on him, goddamn it.

我没有
I didn't.

784
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:43,110
连一根寒毛都没去碰
I wouldn't touch one hair on his goddamn little head.

785
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,850
我爱那个小王八蛋

我会为他做任何事

789
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,630
只要我还活着...
As long as I live...

790
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:07,310
她就不会让我忘记发生过的事
...she'll never let me forget what happened.

791
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,760
我确实伤害过他一次 好不好?
I did hurt him once, okay?

792
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,190
单纯的意外
It was an accident.

793
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,090
完全不算故意的
Completely unintentional.

794
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,600
任何人遇到那种事 都可能那样反应
It could have happened to anybody.

795
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:33,800
而且 他妈的 都过去三个年头了!
And it was three goddamn years ago!

796
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,840
那小杂碎把我的稿纸扔满地
The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor.

797
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,520
我只是想把他拉起来

798

一时肌肉动作失去协调

01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,590
力道多出几磅...
...a few extra foot-pounds of energy...

801
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,630
平均每秒 每秒才...

802
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,650
感谢上帝你在这里

803
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,090
旅馆里除了我们 还有另一个人在

806
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,540
你他妈的神智不清了?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

807
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,500
那是真的 真的!
It's the truth! Really.

808
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,700
我发誓 丹尼告诉我的
I swear it. Danny told me.

809
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:37,910
他上去 进入其中一间卧房
He went up into one of the bedrooms.

810
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,580
门是开着的 他看见这疯女人在浴缸里
The door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub.

811
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:44,120
她想把他掐死!
She tried to strangle him!

812
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,590
在哪个房间?
Which room was it?

...bringing temperatures to the 90s...

819
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:18,120
中部和山区的州区 却被埋在皑皑白雪之中
...Central and Mountain states are buried in snow.

820
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:22,320
今晚光是科罗拉多 几个小时内就积了10英吋厚的雪
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow fell injust a few hours tonight.

821
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,770
几乎不可能在洛矶山脉从事旅游活动
Travel in the Rockies is almost impossible.

822
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,940
机场被迫关闭 滞留了成千上万的旅客
Airports are shut down, stranding thousands of passengers.

823
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,040
高速公路被雪堆阻挡
Highways are blocked by snowdrifts.

824
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,010
铁轨被冻住
Railroad tracks are frozen.

825
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,240
科罗拉多官方告知新闻观察...
Officials in Colorado tell Newswatch...

826
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:38,010
已经至少有三个人在寒风中被冻死
...at least 3 have been killed by exposure to freezing winds.

827
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,520
希望科罗拉多政府...
The governor of Colorado is expected...

828
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,450
宣布进入天气警戒状态
...to declare a weather emergency.

829
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:44,490
应动员全民进行防备...
The National Guard might be called out...

830
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,890
清除街道和公路积雪
...to clear streets and roads.

831
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,330
天气预报 今晚到明天...
Weather forecasters predict more snow...

832
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,520
将有更多的降雪 并伴有强风...
...and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow...

833
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,360
同时温度会降到0度以下
...with temperatures dropping well below zero.

834
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:56,560
回到佛罗里达 我们碰到了相反的问题
Back here in Florida, we've got the opposite problem.

835
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,010
炎热和潮湿预计会更加恶化
The heat and humidity are supposed to climb.

836
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:01,180
应该封锁本地的沙滩
Local beaches should bejammed.

837
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:03,410
我们的气象专家华特克朗斯...
Our weather expert, Walter Cronice...

838
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,880
将在稍后的新闻观察里 为您播报本地天气预报
...will have the local forecast later on Newswatch.

839
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:43,210
对不起 您所拨的号码无法接通
We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

840
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,680
如果您需要帮助请拨叫接线员
If you need assistance, please call the operator.

841
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,770
- 杰克? - 是 是我
- Jack? - Yes, it's me.

842
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,410
感谢上帝
Thank God.

843
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,840
你找到什么了吗?
Did you find anything?

844
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,780
没有 什么也没有
No. Nothing at all.

845
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:20,550
我什么见鬼的东西都没看到
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

846
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:26,790
你去了丹尼说的那间房了吗? 去237?
You went into the room Danny said? To 237?

847
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,560
是的 我去了
Yes, I did.

848
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,830
你什么也没看到?
And you didn't see anything at all?

849
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,030
绝对没有
Absolutely nothing.

850
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,500
他怎么样了?
How is he?

851
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:36,500
他还在睡
He's still asleep.

852
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:38,040
好
Good.

853
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,940
我肯定明天早上 他就会回过神来的
I'm sure he'll be himself again in the morning.

854
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:53,920
你确定就是那个房间吗?
Are you sure it was the right room?

855
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:57,290
我是说 也许丹尼弄错了
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

856
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,870
他一定就是进去那个房间
He must have gone in that room.

857
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,730
门开着 灯也亮着
The door was open, the lights were on.

858
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,710
我只是弄不明白
I just don't understand it.

859
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,080
他脖子上的伤痕是怎么回事?
What about those bruises on his neck?

860
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,590
有人把他弄成那样的
Somebody did that to him.

861
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:29,300
我想是...
I think...

862
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:33,530
他自己弄的
...he did it to himself.

863
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:40,780
不可能
No.

864
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,480
那不可能
That's not possible.

865
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:52,460
一旦你排除他对所发生的事情的说法...
Once you rule out his version of what happened...

866
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,290
就再没有其他解释了
...there is no other explanation.

867
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,100
有吗?
Is there?

868
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:02,370
那和我们来这里前的那次事件...
It wouldn't be that different from the episode...

869
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:05,940
没有什么不同的
...that he had before we came up here.

870
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:07,370
不是吗?
Would it?

871
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:18,280
不管是什么原因...
Whatever the explanation is...

872
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:23,130
我想我们...
...I think we...

873
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:26,060
得带丹尼离开这里
...have to get Danny out of here.

874
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,670
带他离开这里?
Get him out of here?

875
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,580
你的意思是...
You mean...

876
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,590
离开这座旅馆?
...just leave the hotel?

877
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,030
制造一个像这样的问题...
It is so...

878
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,670
这正是你的风格
...typical of you to create a problem like this...

879
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:57,400
当我总算有机会完成什么的时候!
...when I finally have a chance to accomplish something!

880
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:00,170
当我真正投入我的作品的时候!
When I'm really into my work!

881
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,340
如果现在回去 我真的能写出自己的大作 不是吗?
I could really write my own ticket if I went back now, couldn't I?

882
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:08,280
铲铲车道 洗洗车子
Shoveling out driveways, work in a car wash.

883
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,580
这类事情很吸引你?
Any of that appeal to you?

884
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:14,490
到现在我一直让你糟蹋我的生活...
I have let you fuck up my life so far...

885
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:18,320
这次我不会再让你糟蹋了
...but I am not going to let you fuck this up.

886
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,550
晚安 森林服务台
Good evening. Forest Service.

887
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,560
我叫迪克·霍洛朗
My name is Dick Hallorann.

888
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,190
我是遥望旅馆的厨师长
I'm the head chef at the Overlook Hotel.

889
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,520
晚安 有什么我能为您效劳吗?
Good evening. What can I do for you?

890
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:49,290
我一直想打个电话到那上面去 很急...
I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there...

891
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,800
但接线员告诉我线路不通
...but the operator said that the phone lines are down.

892
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:56,600
这周围的很多线路在暴风雪里都断掉了
A lot of lines around here are down due to the storm.

893
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:59,480
我不想给您带来任何麻烦...
I hate to put you through any trouble...

894
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,910
但现在有一家人孤零零的在上头 还带着个小孩子
...but there's a family up there all by themselves with a young kid.

895
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,780
又遇到了这场暴风雪 总之...
And with this storm and everything...

896
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:07,890
如果您能用无线电联系上他们的话 我会非常感激的...
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give them a call on your radio...

897
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,080
只是想看看是不是一切正常
...just to see if everything's okay.

898
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,890
我很乐意这么做
I'll be glad to do that.

899
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,900
你为什么不20分钟后再打给我呢?
Why don't you call me back in about 20 minutes?

900
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,130
非常感谢 我会那样做的
Thank you very much. I'll do that.

901
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,770
好的 先生
All right, sir.

902
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,060
晚安 特朗斯先生
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

903
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,730
晚安
Good evening.

904
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:08,760
嗨 罗伊德
Hi, Lloyd.

905
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,830
离开了一阵子 但现在我又回来了
Been away, but now I'm back.

906
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,830
晚安 特朗斯先生
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

907
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,490
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

908
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,370
回来真不错 罗伊德
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

909
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,740
来点什么呢 先生?
What'll it be, sir?

910
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,810
那只咬过我的狗 它身上的毛 (注: 以毒攻毒之意)
Hair of the dog that bit me.

911
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:25,880
加冰的波本酒
Bourbon on the rocks.

912
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,120
就这么办
That'll do her.

913
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,900
不收您的钱 特朗斯先生
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

914
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,310
不收钱?
No charge?

915
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,930
您的钱在这里用不上
Your money's no good here.

916
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,310
是房子的命令
Orders from the house.

917
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,020
房子的命令
Orders from the house.

918
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,250
喝光吧 特朗斯先生
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

919
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:15,000
我是那种喜欢知道 是谁在帮谁买酒的人 罗伊德
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

920
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:20,240
那与你无关 特朗斯先生
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance.

921
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:22,380
至少 在这点上无关
At least, not at this point.

922
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,590
随你怎么说 罗伊德
Anything you say, Lloyd.

923
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,020
随你怎么说
Anything you say.

924
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,480
噢 天啊! 我真的很抱歉 先生
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

925
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,050
噢 我的天!
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

926
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,810
我把您的夹克弄得一团糟 先生
I've made an awful mess of your jacket, sir.

927
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:57,680
没关系 我有很多的夹克
That's all right. I've got plenty of jackets.

928
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,690
但这是蛋酒 先生 它常常会留下污点
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir. It tends to stain.

929
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,020
蛋酒 是吗?
Advocaat, is it?

930
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,390
是的 先生 我想最好的办法...
Yes, sir. I think the best thing...

931
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,790
就是去男洗手间...
...is to come along to the gentlemen's room...

932
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,530
然后我们用水擦一下 先生
...and we'll get some water to it, sir.

933
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:13,670
看起来好像你身上也沾了一点...
Looks like you might have got a spot of it on yourself...

934
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,860
杰佛西老伙计
...Jeevesy old boy.

935
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,240
那没关系 先生 您比较重要
That doesn't matter, sir. You're the important one.

936
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,950
你这么说真是太好了
Awfully nice of you to say.

937
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:24,250
当然 我想过在晚会前
Of course, I intended to change my jacket this evening...

938
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,720
换件夹克...
...before the fish and goose soiree.

939
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,950
很明智 先生 非常明智
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

940
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,490
这儿 我帮你...
Here. I'll just...

941
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,560
拿着这个 杰佛西
...hold this for you there, Jeevesy.

942
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:35,560
先生 谢谢
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

943
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,230
看看沾点水是不是会好些 先生
Let's see if we can improve this with a little water, sir.

944
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,700
好吧 我把...
All right. I'll just...

945
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:46,110
我的波本酒和蛋酒放在这儿
...set my bourbon and advocaat down right there.

946
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,110
耽误不了您不多久时间
Won't keep you a moment.

947
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,720
好
Fine.

948
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:54,450
他们是怎么叫你的呢 杰佛西?
What do they call you, Jeevesy?

949
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,220
格瑞第 先生 戴伯特·格瑞第
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

950
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,830
格瑞第?
Grady?

951
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:04,360
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

952
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,870
戴伯特·格瑞第
Delbert Grady.

953
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,590
对 先生
That's right, sir.

954
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,750
格瑞第先生...
Mr. Grady...

955
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,610
我该不会以前在哪儿见过你吧?
...haven't I seen you somewhere before?

956
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,520
为什么...? 不是 先生 我不这么认为
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

957
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:33,400
擦掉了 先生
It's coming off now, sir.

958
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:39,900
格瑞第先生...
Mr. Grady...

959
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:43,880
你不是曾经担任过这里的看管员吗?
...weren't you once the caretaker here?

960
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,880
为什么...? 不是 先生 我不这么认为
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

961
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,250
你结婚了 是吗 格瑞第先生?
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?

962
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,290
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

963
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:57,760
我有妻子和两个女儿 先生
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.

964
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,320
那...
And...

965
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,260
她们现在在哪里?
...where are they now?

966
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:07,530
她们就在附近的某个地方 我现在也不能确定
They're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment.

967
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,320
格瑞第先生...
Mr. Grady...

968
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,620
你曾是这里的看管员
You were the caretaker here.

969
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:24,080
我认出你了
I recognize you.

970
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,520
我在报纸上看到过你的照片
I saw your picture in the newspapers.

971
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,730
你...
You...

972
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,730
把你的妻子和女儿剁成碎片
...chopped your wife and daughter up into little bits.

973
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,640
然后...
And...

974
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,210
你把你自己的脑袋轰掉了
...then you blew your brains out.

975
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,890
那真奇怪 先生
That's strange, sir.

976
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:54,620
我对这个完全没有一点印象
I don't have any recollection of that at all.

977
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,170
格瑞第先生...
Mr. Grady...

978
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,940
你曾是这里的看管员
...you were the caretaker here.

979
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,510
很抱歉我和你不一样 先生
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

980
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:18,120
但是你...
But you...

981
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,690
才是看管员
...are the caretaker.

982
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,870
你一直都是看管员
You've always been the caretaker.

983
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,600
我应该知道 先生
I should know, sir.

984
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,630
我一直都在这里
I've always been here.

985
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,060
你知道吗 特朗斯先生...
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

986
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,060
你的儿子...
...that your son...

987
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:00,170
正试图带外面的一帮人...
...is attempting to bring an outside party...

988
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:02,570
加入到这里来?
...into this situation?

989
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:06,840
你知道这个吗?
Did you know that?

990
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:15,180
他正是 特朗斯先生
He is, Mr. Torrance.

991
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:18,690
谁?
Who?

992
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,560
一个黑鬼
A nigger.

993
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,040
一个黑鬼?
A nigger?

994
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,210
一个黑鬼...
A nigger...

995
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:33,500
厨子
...cook.

996
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,280
怎么带法?
How?

997
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,320
你的儿子...
Your son...

998
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,560
有一种非常好的天赋
...has a very great talent.

999
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:53,020
我认为你都不知道那有多高
I don't think you are aware how great it is.

1000
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:57,000
但他正在试图使用他的天赋...
But he is attempting to use that very talent...

1001
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:59,170
用来反抗你的意旨
...against your will.

1002
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:08,980
好...
Well...

1003
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,820
他是个很任性的孩子
...he is a very willful boy.

1004
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:19,630
他的确是 特朗斯先生
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

1005
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:22,730
一个非常任性的孩子
A very willful boy.

1006
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:24,270
一个很...
A rather...

1007
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,000
顽皮的孩子...
...naughty boy...

1008
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:29,410
如果允许我大胆的说 先生
...if I may be so bold, sir.

1009
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:38,420
那是她妈妈
It's his mother.

1010
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,020
她...
She...

1011
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:44,220
妨碍我
...interferes.

1012
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:50,430
也许需要跟他们好好的...
Perhaps they need a good...

1013
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:52,230
谈一谈
...talking-to.

1014
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,500
如果...
If...

1015
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:56,470
你不介意我这么说的话
...you don't mind my saying so.

1016
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,900
也许...
Perhaps...

1017
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,140
光谈还不够
...a bit more.

1018
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:05,580
我的姑娘们 先生...
My girls, sir...

1019
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:09,590
她们开始不喜欢遥望旅馆
...they didn't care for the Overlook at first.

1020
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:14,160
其中一个最后偷了包火柴...
One of them actually stole a pack of matches...

1021
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,030
想把旅馆烧了
...and tried to burn it down.

1022
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,760
但是我...
But I...

1023
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:21,940
纠正了她们 先生
...corrected them, sir.

1024
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:27,400
当我的妻子阻止我 达成我的使命的时候...
And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty...

1025
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:28,870
我...
...I...

1026
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,970
纠正了她
...corrected her.

1027
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:48,170
我们有雪地车
We have the Snowcat.

1028
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,340
如果天气稍微变好...
If the weather breaks...

1029
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,310
我们就能...
...we might just be able...

1030
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,380
下山去了
...to get down the mountain.

1031
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,220
我可以先给林务员打电话...
I could call the forest rangers first...

1032
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,920
告诉他们我们来了
...and...tell them that we're coming...

1033
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,450
这样...
....so that...

1034
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:12,760
如果我们后来没到达 他们就会来找我们
...they could start searching for us in case we didn't make it.

1035
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,700
如果杰克不陪我们走的话...
And if Jack won't come with us...

1036
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:24,910
我只有告诉他 我们自己走了
...I'll just have to tell him that we're going by ourselves.

1037
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,080
就这么办了
That's all there is to it.

1038
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,940

Redrum红酒!
Redrum!

1042
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,360
你在做恶梦吗?
Are you having a bad dream?

1043
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,540
宝贝?
Hon?

1044
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:05,260
丹尼不在这儿 特朗斯太太
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1045
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,790

醒醒啊
Wake up.

1047
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:17,400
你只是做了个恶梦
You just had a bad dream.

1048
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:20,940
没事了
Everything's okay.

1049
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:28,880
丹尼不能醒来了 特朗斯太太
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1051
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:42,670

01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,240
醒醒!
Wake up!

1054
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:54,310
丹尼离开了 特朗斯太太
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

We tried to contact them several times but they didn't answer.

那边天气怎么样?
How's the weather down there?

1082
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,480
我没在佛罗里达 我在斯塔普列顿机场给你打电话
I'm not in Florida. I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1083
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,450
你在那儿干什么?
What are you doing there?

1084
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:55,330
我刚从迈阿密来 我今天要去遥望旅馆
I just got in from Miami. I got to get to the Overlook today.

1085
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:57,160
那里天气如何?
What's the weather like there?

1086
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,670
扫雪机不断在运作 货物还是能运进城...
The snowplows are keeping things moving in town...

1087
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:02,810
但是山路全被封死了
...but the mountain roads are blocked.

1088
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:06,040
那我找辆雪地车上去
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat to get up there.

1089
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,080
你能给我弄出一辆吗?
Can you fix me up with one?

1090
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,370
出了什么大事 非得今天上那儿...?
What's the big deal about getting there today...

1091
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,140
尤其是在这种天气?

赖利 只在你我之间说说 我们遇上了很严重的问题...
Larry, just between you and me, we got a very serious problem...

关于看管那个地方的人
...with the people taking care of the place.

1094
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:23,000
他们根本就在打混摸鱼
They turned out to be completely unreliable assholes.

1095
