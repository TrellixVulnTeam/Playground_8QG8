躲猫猫
Peek-a-boo!

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,240
别哭  别哭  别哭
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,040
我不是故意吓你的  我的小宝贝
I didn't mean to startle you, my little baby.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,480
小吸血鬼宝宝  别说话
Hush, little vampire, don't say a word

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,280
爸爸会把鸟头咬下来
Papa's gonna bite the head off a bird

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,290
你个小不点儿
A-bitty goo-bah!

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,490
我想亲亲你的小屁股
I want to kiss your tush.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,560
亲亲小屁股
I want to kiss your tush!

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,140
很好  但是面积要再大点
Nice, but maybe a little more square footage.

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,810
可以容纳更多妖怪
I want a lot of monsters here.

25
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,350
我来抓你啦  小梅维斯
I'm gonna get you, little Mavis.

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,490
我要抓住你啦
I'm gonna get you!

27
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,590
外面有什么
What out there?

28
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,960
我们从不去外面
Oh, we never go out there.

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,290
永远不
Ever.

30
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,570
后来妖怪们纷纷逃跑并躲起来
"And then the monsters ran away and were forced into hiding.

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,750
{\an8}人类的故事

32
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,440
但叫哈利的人类发现了他们
"But Harry the Human found them 

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,300
从他们的床底下蹦出来
"and jumped out from under their bed."

34
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,390
我好怕怕
I'm scared!

35
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,470
烧了他们的衣服
"And burned their clothes.

36
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,440
咬他们的脚趾头
"And bit their toes!

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,480
还抢走了他们的糖果
"And took their candy!"

38
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,750
不要抢走我的糖果
Don't take my candy.

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,850
小宝贝  别害怕
Babyclaws, you don't need to be frightened.

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,290
我答应过你妈咪会永远保护你
I promised your mommy I would protect you forever.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,890
我美丽的梅维斯
My beautiful May-vey

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,370
我帮你把屁屁擦干净
Let me wipe all your poop away

43
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,340
那帮人类都好坏坏
Those humans are nas-tay

44
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,810
还是和爸爸在一起吧
So with Daddy you will stay

45
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,010
要是有人想伤害你
And if a human tries to harm you

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,380
我就会
I'll simply say

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,920
你是爸爸的小闺女
Because you're Daddy's girl

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,190
爸爸的小闺女
Daddy's girl

49
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,860
双腿弯曲  跳下来
Just bend the legs and push off.

50
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,760
相信我  小耗子
Trust me, mouse.

51
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,230
我会飞啦  我会飞啦
I can fly! I can fly!

52
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,400
看看你
Look at you!

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,700
再快点  宝贝  再快点
Faster, baby! Faster!

54
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,400
你成功了  我的小魔女
You got it, my little voodoo doll!

55
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,280
打扰了  先生
Excuse me, sir.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,080
怎么了  又怎么了
What? What?

57
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
我没事
Ow. I'm Okay.

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,650
已经盖好了
It's ready.

59
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,320
看着不错
Looks good.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,190
只有妖怪可以进来吗
Only monsters can get in?

61
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,760
当然了
Oh, absolutely.

62
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,990
隐蔽地非常好
It's hidden real nicely.

63
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,860
前方有400英亩幽灵森林
You got 400 acres of haunted forest in front of you.

64
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,100
周围是亡灵禁区
You got the Land of the Undead on the perimeters.

65
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,030
有谁敢朝那边多瞄一眼
Any humans daring to even look over there 

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,970
都会仓皇而逃
will run away real quick.

67
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,420
但要切记
But, of course, be smart.

68
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,060
不能有篝火  不要办烟火表演
No bonfires, no firework shows.

69
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,560
不能有火  我知道了
Yeah, yeah, no, no. No fire, I get it, I get it.

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,560
终于好了  我亲爱的玛莎
It's time, my darling Martha.

71
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,030
我们以前常说要为梅维斯建造的地方
The place we always talked about for Mavis.

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,740
这里永远没人能伤害她
No one will ever harm her here.

73
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,560
精灵旅社

{\an8}亡灵

76
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,760
后面乱糟糟的
Yeah, it's a mess back there.

77
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,780
欢迎来到精灵旅社

始于1898年的无人类旅馆

79
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,220
你最安全的落脚点

80
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,880
拿一份日程表
Take an itinerary.

81
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,890
我亲自设计了许多精彩的活动

82
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,620
都是为我女儿明天的庆生盛会
all leading to my daughter's birthday extravaganza tomorrow.

83
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,830
我们每年都盼着来呢  伯爵
We always look forward to coming every year, Count.

84
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,830
我们特别青睐此处的安全性
We enjoy the safety so much.

85
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,160
那是当然  我们就是为此才建的旅馆
Of course. That's why we built it.

86
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,600

87

你看起来还是那么白

89
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,040

91
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,910

348房间的厕所堵了
There is a clogged toilet in room 348.

It's Okay. We all get stomach aches, Mr. Bigfoot.

孩子们  过来
Hey, kids, reel it in.

96
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,460
别给爸妈惹麻烦
You're only supposed to make Mom and Dad miserable.

97
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,960
这样可不乖哦
Now, now, is that any way to behave?

98
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,170
这是旅馆  不是墓地
This is a hotel, not a cemetery.

99
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,970
对不起  德库拉叔叔
Sorry, Uncle Drac.

你们家看起来其乐融融
The family looks beautiful.

105
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,580
他们弄脏的让我清理就行了

Still traveling by mail, Mr. Cheapo, huh?

109
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,470
不是钱的问题
It's not a money thing.

110
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,070
我有飞机恐惧症  好吗
I have a plane phobia, okay?

111
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,810
我是说  那些引擎随时可能着
I mean, at any moment, those engines could catch...

112
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,910
火  没错  火是坏东西
Fire! Yeah, yeah. "Fire bad."

113
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,210
我们知道
We know.

114
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,610

那个像是弗兰克斯坦的头吗
Does that look like Frankenstein's head?

116
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,350
德库拉  老兄  你的披肩怎么了
Hey, Drac, buddy, what's going on with your cape there?

117
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,160
什么意思
What do you mean?

118
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,820
谁掐了我
Who pinched me?

119
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,060
抱歉  你太迷人了
Guilty. You're irresistible.

好吧  你赢了  拿着培根
Okay, you win. Hold this bacon.

126
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,370
干嘛要我拿着培根
Why am I holding bacon... Ahh!

127
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,910
不要  叫他们下去

128
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,780

你好  默里
Hello, Murray!

德库拉  还好吗  老兄
Drac, what's up, buddy?

131
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,290
沙子  默里  沙子
The sand, Murray, the sand!

132
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,390
总是风尘仆仆的
Always with the sand.

133
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,030
沃尔夫  旺达  弗兰克

我喜欢这家伙
I love this guy.

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,630
他总是声嘶力竭
He always bringing it full tilt.

136
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,000
你看起来又瘦了
You're looking skinny, too.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
瘦得就剩一个头了
Now that you're just a head.

138
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,040
我饶不了你
Okay, you'll pay for that.

139
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,840
最近怎么样  德库拉
So what's up, Drac?

140
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,250
旅馆现在运营得不错
The hotel is looking off the hook.

141
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,780
各位  瞧好吧
Hey, guys, watch this.

142
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,490
顺便说一句  你指对路了
By the way, you were right about those directions.

143
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,690
很好  很好
Oh, good, good.

144
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,110
真的  我从底格里斯河走到尼罗河 
Yeah, I took the Tigris through the Nile, 

145
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,060
一路畅行无阻
and there was absolutely no traffic.

146
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,800
开什么玩笑
You're kidding me.

147
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,400
我的大厅放屁
Right in my lobby?

148
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,240
德库拉  我发誓  不是我放的
Drac, I swear, man, I don't run like that.

149
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,340
客房部
Housekeeping!

150
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,920
真的不是我
I was not the cause of that.

151
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,190
我们织好了
We're ready!

152
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,940

很高兴你们能来此欢庆
I am so glad you are here to celebrate.

157
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,400
我可爱的小梅维斯的生日
Another birthday for my sweet little Mavis,

158
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,810
庆祝我们又成功躲过他们一年
and another successful year of refuge from them!

159
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,880
这些是我们监测到的近期人类影像
These are recent human images our surveillance has uncovered.

160
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,050
他们越来越胖以便能打败我们
They are getting fatter so as to overpower us.

161
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,180
他们身上的衣服越穿越少
And they are wearing less clothing,

162
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,420
更能大展拳脚勒死我们
allowing more movement to strangle us

163
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,490
或者砍掉我们的头当糖罐
or cut open our heads and put candy in them.

164
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,630
但他们永远不会发现我们在这儿
But they will never find us here.

165
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,030
坏人  你们是不会得逞的
Evil villain, you will never win!

166
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,830
好了  30分钟后好戏登台
Okey-doke. The fun starts in 30 minutes.

167
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,930
现在  我得去看我的小闺女
Right now, I have to see my little girl.

168
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,600
她可不小了
She's not so little anymore!

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,670
不  她就是小
Yes, she is!

170
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,680
外面什么情况
What's going on out there?

171
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,580
我们到旅馆了吗
Are we at the hotel?

172
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,650
弗兰克  你预约双人按摩了吗
Frank, did you book us for a tandem massage?

173
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,820
在钟楼餐厅订位子了吗
Did you get us a table at Hunchback's?

174
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,120
你有没有在做事
Did you do anything?

175
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,820
不客气
You're welcome.

176
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,750
怎么回事
What's going on?

177
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,580
爸爸  你说过等我到了118岁
Dad, you said that when I turned 118,

178
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,930
就能像那些来旅馆的其他成人一样
I could go out into the world

179
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,000
去外面的世界看看
like every other adult that gets to come and go from this hotel.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,210
可是小梅  这不安全
"But, Mavey Wavey, it's not safe."

181
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,900
爸爸  30年前你答应过我
Dad, 30 years ago, you promised.

182
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,940
记得当时我们在吃老鼠
I remember, we were both eating mice,

183
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,970
你信誓旦旦地向我保证过
and you specifically said that you gave me your word.

184
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,980
请勿打扰
Do not disturb.

185
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,180
请勿打扰  请勿打扰
Do not disturb. Do not disturb.

186
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,510
请勿打扰
Do not disturb.

187
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,020
请勿打扰  请勿打扰
Do not disturb. Do not disturb.

188
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,850
-请勿打扰  -早上好  阁下
- Do not disturb. - Good morning, Your Eminence.

189
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,920
女佣  把这间打扫干净
Maid, clean up this room!

190
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,120
是你啊  很高兴你能来
It's you. Glad you could make it.

191
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,660
-她起了吗  -起了
- Is she up yet? - Oh, she's up.

192
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,250
她准备走了  我的意思是离家出走
She's ready to go. And by "Go," I mean go. 

193
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,230
是去外面的世界看看
As in, go check the world out.

194
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,400
你怎么办  你会怎么说
What you gonna do? What you gonna say?

195
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,200
我都安排好了  你做好你的事就行了
I got it covered. Please, relax. Just do your job.

196
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,740
早上好  小梅
Good morning, Mavey Wavey!

197
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,510
生日快乐  我的小耗子
Happy birthday, my little mouse!

198
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,740
谢谢  爸爸
Thank you, Dad.

199
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,810
我知道是我生日
I know it's my birthday.

200
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,100
我安排了好多好玩的
I have so much fun planned. 

201
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,050
但首先  我们要一起抓蝎子
But first, we go catch some scorpions together,

202
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,850
就我们俩  怎么样
just the two of us, yes, dead-ums?

203
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,190
爸爸  听我说句话
Dad, please, let me speak.

204
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,090
有些事我们得谈谈
There's something we have to talk about.

205
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,190
你想去外面的世界看看  去吧
You want to go out into the world. You can.

206
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,060
我就知道你会这么说
I knew you were gonna say that.

207
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,960
可是  爸爸  你向我保证过
But, Dad, you gave me your word,

208
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,530
德库拉的承诺是神圣的
and you know that I know that a Dracula's word is sacred.

209
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,930
我们之间的信任最重要
That our trust is the core of our...

210
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,100
等下  你刚说什么
Wait, what?

211
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,770
我说你可以离开
I said you can go.

212
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,400
你是在耍我吧
You're just playing with me.

213
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,940
不  不  你已经到了能开灵车的岁数
No, no, no, no. You're old enough to drive a hearse now,

214
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,710
你可以自己做决定了
you're old enough to make your own choices.

215
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,040
你可以离开
You can go.

216
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,810
我滴个兔乖乖
Holy rabies! Holy rabies!

217
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,520
先别走
Stop.

218
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,420
等一下  小尖牙
Wait a second, sweetfangs.

219
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,920
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

220
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,060
我要去天堂
Oh, well, I'm going to Paradise,

221
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,230
这些是我觉得用得上的东西
and this is just some stuff that I thought I would need.

222
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,690
天堂  
Paradise? 

223
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,200
对啊  就是你和妈妈相遇的地方
Yeah, you know. It's that place out there where you and Mom met.

224
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,150
{\an8}天堂

225
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,700
旺达阿姨说你俩一见钟情
Auntie Wanda says you two were just like, Zing!

226
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,200
我可不知道什么一见钟情
I don't know from "Zing."

227
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,040
你从哪儿找到的这张卡片
Where did you find that card?

228
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,970
你抽屉里
In one of your drawers.

229
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,710
你怎么从来不给我讲你们是如何相识的
Why won't you ever tell me about how you met?

230
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,080
其实是在夏威夷
It's actually Hawaii.

231
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,150
夏什么
Ha-what-what?

232
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,980
宝贝  我知道你很激动
Look, honey, I know you're excited,

233
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,500
可大家都不远万里
but everyone has gone to great lengths 

234
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,020
来为你庆祝生日
to come see you on your birthday.

235
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,420
我知道  他们一直如此
I know. They always do.

236
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,060
可我都这么大了  不适合办这种派对
But aren't I getting a little old for these parties?

237
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,830
我喜欢派对  但我真的想体验新事物
I love them, but I really want to see new things.

238
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,500
想认识同龄人
Maybe meet somebody my age.

239
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,770
拜托  别  别  别这样
Come on. No, no, don't do that.

240
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,300
别摆出这副闷闷不乐的样子
Don't give me the pouty batface.

241
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,810
好吧  就在离墓地不远的地方
Okay, there is a human village

242
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,510
有个人类的村庄
just a little ways past the cemetery.

243
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,480
你可以去玩个三十分钟左右
You could go there and be back in, like, 30 minutes or so.

244
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,380
对你第一次出行来说足够了
It should be plenty for your first time.

245
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,010
好吧  虽然不是夏威威
Well, it's not Ha-wee-wee, 

246
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,790
但怎么说也算外出了
but I guess it's still technically out there.

247
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,190
好  好  好
Okay, okay, okay!

248
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,030
谢谢你相信我
Thanks for trusting me.

249
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,700
当然了  我的小宝贝
Of course, my little one.

250
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,460
我向你保证过的
I gave you my word.

251
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,630
你好  宝贝
Hey, honey!

252
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,170
-看啊  -你们好
- Look at this! - Hey, guys.

253
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,270
对明天的到来很激动吧
You excited about tomorrow?

254
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,140
我现在更激动
Not as excited as I am right now.

255
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,270
说了你们也不信  
You're not gonna believe this, 

256
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,780
爸爸让我一个人去人类的村庄看看
but Dad is letting me go out on my own to see a human village!

257
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,780
-什么  -不行
- What? - No!

258
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,950
抱歉  德库拉
Excuse me. Drac!

259
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,280
你疯了吗
Have you lost it?

260
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,180
让你女儿外出
Letting your own daughter out there

261
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,490
和你常对我们说的恐怖人类待在一起
with those horrible humans you always tell us about?

262
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,790
你为此才建的这地方
That's why you built this place.

263
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,720
他们恨我们  他们很恶毒
They hate us. They're vicious.

264
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,690
而且还吵死人了
And they're very loud!

265
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,290
尤妮斯阿姨  也许他们变了呢
Auntie Eunice, maybe they've changed.

266
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,830
我就飞到街边看看是什么样
I'm just gonna fly down the street and see how it goes.

267
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,800
好吧  宝贝  注意安全
Okay, honey, be safe.

268
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,870
带上暖和衣服还有剑
Bring warm clothes and a sword.

269
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,370
当心干草叉
And look out for pitchforks.

270
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,440
别让人把你的你脑子挖出来
Don't you let anyone scoop your brains out, either.

271
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,970
或许待在暗处就好
Maybe stay in the shadows.

272
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,170
从地下室观察也挺有意思
It's more fun to just observe from under a house.

273
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,110
各位  各位  她能处理
Guys, guys. She can handle it.

274
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,350
她是个吸血鬼  看在上帝的份上
She's a Dracula, for Pete's sake.

275
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,650
但说真的  小心火焰
But seriously, watch out for fire.

276
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,380
火可不是好东西
Fire bad.

277
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,930
再见  各位
Bye, everyone.

278
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,270
德库拉  
Drac, 

279
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,880
不敢相信你对她的离开如此淡定
I can't believe how calm you are about her leaving.

280
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,550
真为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

281
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,780
德库拉  德库拉
Drac? Drac?

282
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,420
德库拉跑哪儿去了
Where did Drac go?

283
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,490
太棒了
This is awesome!

284
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,960
果然有个墓地  跟爸爸说的一样
There's the cemetery, just like Dad said.

285
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,630
有人吗
Uh... Hello?

286
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,130
有人在吗
Anybody out there?

287
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,950
-吸血鬼  -咬脚趾
- Vampire. - Bite toes!

288
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,620
你们好  人类
Hi, humans.

289
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,360
没事吧  我叫梅维斯·德库拉  我...
Everything Okay? My name is Mavis Dracula, and I...

290
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,790
吸血鬼
Vampire.

291
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,560
-烧衣服  -烧我的衣服吗
- Burn clothes. - Burn my clothes?

292
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,890
-真的吗  -吸血鬼
- Really? - Vampire!

293
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,430
-我们要抢走你的糖果  -糖果
- We take your candy. - Candy!

294
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,900
我没有恶意  真的
I'm friendly. I really am.

295
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,970
-冷静一下  -糖果
- Calm down, now. - Candy.

296
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,770
我就是想打个招呼
I just wanted to say hi.

297
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,560
拜托  我从未伤害过人
Please. I've never hurt anyone.

298
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,730
我都在家自修
I'm homeschooled.

299
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,500
那是大蒜吗
Is that garlic?

300
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,210
我滴个兔乖乖  你们着火了
Holy rabies, you're on fire.

301
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,710
我能做什么  能帮你们吗
Can I do anything? Can I help you?

302
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,410
爸爸说得没错
Dad was right.

303
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,420
爸爸说得没错
Dad was right.

304
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,630
这招管用了
It worked.

305
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,400
这下我的宝贝永远安全了
Now my baby will be safe forever.

306
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,140
好了  各位  马上回去干活
All right, everybody, get back to work now.

307
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,010
不要拿模特
You don't need a mannequin.

308
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,580
把服装放下  快点儿
Leave the mannequin here. Come on.

309
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,470
你去哪儿了
Where you been?

310
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,300
你干嘛鬼鬼祟祟的
Why you sneaking around?

311
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,710
安静
Quiet.

312
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,380
亲爱的  你怎么这么快就回来了
Sweetheart, have you returned so soon?

313
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,810
进来吧  爸爸
Oh. Come in, Dad.

314
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,850
好玩吗  外面的世界怎么样啊
How'd it go? How was the big world?

315
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,410
外面怎么样啊
How was it out there?

316
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,920
还行吧  爸爸
It was okay, Dad.

317
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,480
怎么了  发生什么事了
What? What's the matter?

318
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,290
爸爸  你说得对
Dad, you were right.

319
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,990
人类太可怕了
Humans are awful.

320
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,890
跟你说的一模一样
They were everything you said.

321
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,290
-他们要咬我的脚趾  -你的脚趾
- They wanted to bite my toes. - Your toes?

322
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,060
他们还往面包上放大蒜
And they had garlic on bread.

323
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,430
什么  你看我
What? Look at me.

324
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,530
我都起鸡皮疙瘩了  我好害怕
I'm getting goose bumps, I'm so scared.

325
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,000
我很抱歉  亲爱的
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

326
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,640
很抱歉让你经历这些
I hate that you had to see that.

327
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,770
对不起我不该怀疑你
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

328
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,380
我再也不离开这儿了
I'll never leave here again.

329
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,120
没事了  没事了
Okay. Okay.

330
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,590
爸爸会给你过一个最棒的生日
Look, Daddy's going to make you the bestest birthday ever.

331
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,960
看我给你带了什么
Look what I brought you.

332
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,660
你的虫虫蛋糕
Your wormcakes.

333
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,590
别不高兴了
Don't be sad anymore.

334
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,490
别忘了
Remember,

335
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,830
今年我们要打开妈妈给你的礼物
this is the year we open Mommy's present for you.

336
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,270
她给了我什么
What did she get me?

337
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,800
到时候就知道了
We'll see.

338
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,970
她说在你118岁之前不能打开
She said never to open until you're 118.

339
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,940
我们都等了那么久了
We've waited this long.

340
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,480
吃你的虫虫蛋糕吧
You eat your wormcakes.

341
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,250
什么时候准备好了就下来  宝贝
You come down whenever you're ready, honey.

342
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,680
你做了什么
What did you do?

343
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,850
做我该做的
What I had to.

344
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
有朝一日她会感激我的
She'll thank me one day.

345
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,960
是啊  把我头缩小的人也这么说
Yeah, that's what the guy who shrunk my head said.

346
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,910
干得不错  你想要什么  点心吗
Yes, what do you want, a cookie?

347
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,010
做得好  伙计
You did all right, man.

348
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,240
离开这儿
Move on already.

349
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,250
就这儿了
Yeah.

350
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,990
吸血鬼  吸血鬼
Vampire! Vampire!

351
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,990
人类
A human.

352
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,290
你是谁  你是怎么发现这的
Who are you? And how did you find this place?

353
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,930
我叫乔纳森
Oh, I'm Jonathan.

354
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,900
我和一些朋友来登山
And I was just mountain climbing with some dudes,

355
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,300
然后听到幽灵森林的传说
and heard this story about a spooky forest.

356
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,810
有谁不想去幽灵森林  你说是吧
And who's not going to go into a spooky forest, right?

357
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,410
后来我看到这些着火的傻家伙
So, then I see these goofy-looking dudes on fire.

358
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,850
就尾随他们来到这座神奇的城堡
And I just kind of followed them to this, like, amazing castle.

359
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,520
但要切记
But, of course, be smart.

360
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,890
不能有篝火  不能办烟火表演
No bonfires, no firework shows.

361
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,290
-你们有多少人  -就我一个
- How many of you are there? - Just me.

362
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,100
我喜欢独来独往
I like to hit it alone.

363
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
在青年旅社能遇到很多厉害的人
You meet so many awesome people in the youth hostels.

364
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,970
说到厉害  这件披肩好拉风
Hey, speaking of awesome, that cape thing is killing it.

365
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,540
这在举行化装舞会吗
Is there, like, a costume party here?

366
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,940
我都干了什么
What have I done?

367
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,440
都怪我
This is all my fault.

368
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,370
你得离开这里
You have to leave.

369
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,880
-糟了  -不好意思
- Oh, no. - Excuse me.

370
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,350
你湖里的食人鱼真是粗鲁
One of your piranhas in the lake is very rude.

371
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,080
他把我小姑给吃了
He ate my sister-in-law.

372
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,380
我马上回来处理
Be right with you.

373
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,490
德库拉先生  我们要面向泳池的房间
Mr. Dracula, we asked for a room with a view of the pool.

374
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,360
房间不错  我们要预约按摩
The room's fine. We want to book a massage.

375
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,420
是啊  瑞典指压按摩
Yes, Swedish. Shiatsu.

376
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,020
精油按摩  放松下背部  
Aromatherapy. Lower back.

377
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,290
你这里有热石吗  我们想按摩一下
Do you have hot-stone? We want a massage.

378
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,790
-我晚点回来处理  多头先生  -但愿如此
- I'll get back to you, Mr. Hydraberg. - I hope so.

379
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,430
我表示怀疑  等你处理
I doubt it. See that you do.

380
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,460
我是多头小姐  谢谢
That's Ms. Hydraberg. Thanks.

381
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,330
-是啊  很高兴见到你  -老兄  你到底怎么了
- Yes, nice to see you. - Dude, seriously, what's up?

382
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,930
这个聚会太给力了
It's kind of funky to breathe under here.

383
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,500
德库拉  德库拉  小梅近来如何
Drac. Drac. How'd it go with Mavey?

384
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,670
你要去哪儿
Where'd you go?

385
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,880
城堡这么大  房间却这么小
This room's kind of small for a big castle.

386
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,410
连床也没有  但这个簸箕真酷
No bed, but check out these awesome dustpans they give you.

387
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,220
闭嘴  你个白痴
Quiet, you fool.

388
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,150
你包里装了什么武器
What weapons are you keeping in this container?

389
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,650
干草叉
Your pitchforks?

390
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,190
我无法呼吸了
I can't breathe.

391
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,860
这味道熏死我了
It's killing me.

392
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,630
是啊  是该洗了
Yeah, definitely due for a fluff and fold.

393
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,560
这是什么
What is this?

394
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,060
是刑具吗
A torture device?

395
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,800
神秘的大脑控制器吗
A secret mind controller?

396
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,630
你看不到我的想法
You won't read my thoughts.

397
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,040
我不会给你这个机会
I won't let you.

398
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,500
大哥  音乐播放器而已
Dude, it's just music.

399
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,170
戴上试试
Here, try it.

400
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,740
我的魂都快被吸走了
It's taking my soul!

401
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,080
什么  这是即兴演奏  别那么老土
What? It's a good jam. Don't be a grandpa.

402
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,250
你得离开这里
You need to go.

403
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,970
从未有人类进入这城堡
No human has ever entered this castle.

404
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,120
如果你被人看见
And if someone should see you,

405
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,260
就再没人敢来这个旅馆了
the safety of the hotel, the sanctuary,

406
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,590
避难所将不复存在
no one would ever come again.

407
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,630
好啊  接着说
Yeah, go for it.

408
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,000
再没人敢来
"Ever come again!"

409
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
我喜欢你的声音  很像德库拉  学得超像  
I love your Dracula voice. It's so over the top.

410
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,660
还有梅维斯  如果她看见你
And Mavis, if she saw you, 

411
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,040
我的谎话就被戳穿了  不行
she would know that I lied. No!

412
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,880
谁是梅维斯  这是她的房间吗
Who's Mavis? Is this her room?

413
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,580
我不介意和人同住
I'm good with a roommate.

414
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,250
我家一共兄弟六人  我很懂得分享 
I had six brothers growing up, so I could totally share.

415
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,710
我也不能杀了他
I can't kill him.

416
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,850
那会让妖怪的文明倒退几百年
It would set monsters back hundreds of years.

417
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,680
有一次我在汉堡和人同住
One time, in Hamburg, I roomed with this dude

418
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,550
我抓到那人偷我的洗发水
who I caught stealing my shampoo.

419
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,560
我说  住手  结果
I said, "Whoa, man," And

420
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,460
他朝我扔来一个花盆  但他人还不错
he threw a flower pot at me, but he was cool.

421
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,890
你瞎唠叨什么呢
What are you babbling about?

422
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,590
什么
What? 

423
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,130
看这些戏服多棒啊
Check out these awesome costumes.

424
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,300
戏服
Costumes.

425
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,270
这是什么  抱歉  我不能丢下背包
What's this? Sorry, man. I just can't be without my backpack.

426
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,020
我所有家当都在里面  不能离身  
You know, everything I own's in there. 

427
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,500
就放在这
It'll be right here.

428
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,440
好吧  我只是太爱我的背包了
Okay, I just... I love my backpack.

429
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,910
你在干什么
What are you doing?

430
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,740
你这是  你要对我的头发做什么
What are you... What are you doing to my hair?

431
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,240
住手  等等  痒死了
Stop. Wait, that tickles.

432
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,210
别闹了
Come on, man.

433
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,320
快看啊  我是科学怪人
Check it out. I'm a Franken-homie.

434
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,550
大家好  看看我啊
Yes, hello. Look at me!

435
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,820
一切正常  什么事也没有
This is totally normal, not a problem here.

436
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,460
不过是我身边的一个怪物
This is just a monster with me.

437
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,990
大家今晚都盛装打扮啊
Man, everybody stepped it up tonight.

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,660
等等  我们为什么去门口  要走了吗
Wait, why are we going to the front door? Are we leaving?

439
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,930
早安  德库拉
Bonjour,Dracula!

440
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,730
你好  大鼻子
Sniffy. What's going on?

441
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,500
现在不是时候  加西莫多  
Not right now, Quasimodo.

442
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,540
什么
What?

443
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,640
不可能  别胡说  
No. Don't be absurd.

444
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
他不是人类  他是德库拉先生
It's not a human, but Monsieur Dracula.

445
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,110
真好笑  是我啦
How ridiculous. It's me.

446
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,220
先生
Monsieur.

447
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,820
-这是芥末蜥蜴趾  -芥末蜥蜴趾
- The devilled lizard fingers. - Devilled lizard fingers?

448
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,550
我让你做的是脾脏卷
I asked for spleens-in-blankets.

449
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,660
你个白痴  我跟你说过  他不喜欢
You ugly fool! I told you, he doesn't like

450
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,120
-蜥蜴指  -可是你说
- the lizard fingers! - But you said...

451
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,760
看看这身装扮
Check that costume out.

452
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,980
说真的  我很想问你
Seriously, I just have to ask you: 

453
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,830
你是怎么做到的
How are you pulling this off?

454
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,700
这造型太逼真了
I mean, it looks so real.

455
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,600
好像我的手指都能穿过去
Like, I could just put my hand right through...

456
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,770
你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

457
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,540
她是真的骷髅  你也是
She's real. You're real!

458
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,270
是啊  我还会真的揍你一顿
Yeah, and I'll give you a real beating.

459
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,650
别用你的脏手碰我老婆
Keep your hands out of my wife!

460
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,090
别别
No.

461
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,760
亲爱的  我不知道你在哪儿
Honey, I just didn't know where you were.

462
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,060
我们都以为你还在外面
We thought you were still out.

463
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,530
不  我都不知道自己为什么非要出去
No. I don't know why I ever wanted to leave.

464
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,200
人类真无聊
The humans are so boring.

465
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,950
梅维斯  宝贝  你没事吧
Mavis, honey, are you all right?

466
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,020
我没事  真是奇怪
Yeah, I think so. That was weird.

467
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,050
我头好疼
My head hurts.

468
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,920
-那个人是谁  -什么人
- Who is that? - Who is what?

469
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,560
那个啊
That.

470
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,630
没有什么人
That is nobody.

471
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,900
-别开玩笑了  爸爸  -爸爸
- Seriously, Dad? - "Dad"?

472
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,270
是啊  德库拉的女儿  谁都会被吓到
Yeah, I know, Dracula's daughter. Everyone freaks out at first.

473
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,570
德库拉
Dracula?

474
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,630
好了  我们得走了
Okay, we got to go.

475
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,670
求你别杀我  我还这么年轻
Please don't kill me. I'm so young.

476
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,210
我还有许多地方没去过
I have so many places I want to see.

477
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,280
我都买了戴夫·马休斯乐队演唱会的票
I've got tickets to six Dave Matthews Band concerts.

478
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,150
我要出去
I'm getting out of here.

479
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,120
把嘴闭上
Shut up already.

480
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,750
你总嚷嚷我没法思考
It's impossible for me to think with all your noise.

481
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,620
抱歉  格伦  接着睡吧
Sorry, Glen. Go back to sleep.

482
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,720
等等  你是要吸我的血吗  
Wait. Aren't you going to suck my blood? 

483
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,330
典型的人类妄想症
Classic human paranoia.

484
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,030
人类都血脂高  不知道血里有什么疾病
Human blood is so fatty, and you never know where it's been.

485
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,870
那德库拉不吸血吗
So, Dracula doesn't drink blood?

486
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,710
不  我有替代品
No, I use a blood substitute.

487
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,970
人造血还有混合剂什么的
Either Near Blood or Blood Beaters.

488
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,910
喝起来没什么区别
You can't tell the difference.

489
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,780
你是真的德库拉伯爵
So, you're, like, the real Count Dracula.

490
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,780
你是不是常说  我是德库拉  吓死你
Like, "I'm Dracula. Bleh, bleh-bleh."

491
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,320
我这辈子都没那么说过话  吓死你
I've never said that in my life. Bleh, bleh-bleh

492
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,420
都不知道人们怎么杜撰的
I don't know where that comes from.

493
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,560
我能问这到底是什么地方吗
Can I just ask, what exactly is this place?

494
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,830
这是什么地方
What is this place?

495
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,370
这是我为外面那些怪物所建的避难所
It's a place I built for all those monsters out there,

496
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,810
使他们能隐藏在黑暗中  躲避人类的迫害
lurking in the shadows, hiding from the persecution of humankind.

497
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,210
这里能让他们和家人休闲娱乐
A place for them and their families to come to and be themselves.

498
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,620
这里没有火把  干草叉和愤怒的人群 
A place void of torches, pitchforks, angry mobs.

499
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,720
一个远离纷争
A place of peace, relaxation

500
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,290
宁静祥和的地方
and tranquility.

501
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,060
不错嘛  这么说这里是怪物旅店咯
Cool. So, it's like a hotel for monsters?

502
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,030
没错  怪物旅店  可以这么说  
Yes, exactly. "A hotel for monsters." Way to sum it up.

503
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,770
好了  爬到我背上  咱们出发
Okay, hop on my back. We're leaving.

504
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,700
你变成蝙蝠了
You're a bat now.

505
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,100
我做梦都想飞  那是什么感觉
I always wanted to fly. What's it like?

506
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,040
太疯狂了  等等  等等  我想留下
This is insane. Wait. Wait, I want to stay.

507
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,140
能让弗兰克斯坦在我衣服上给我签个名吗  
Can Frankenstein sign my costume? 

508
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,540
我能去看看隐形人吗
Can I meet the Invisible Man?

509
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,940
如果我把手放到隐形人嘴里
If I stuck my hand in the Invisible Man's mouth,

510
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,710
手会消失吗
would it disappear?

511
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,550
小梅  我的小甜心  你怎么来了
Mavey! What are you doing, my sweet little blood orange?

512
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,720
我们的朋友正要走呢
Our friend was just leaving.

513
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,320
是啊  他把我撵出窗外
Yeah, he was flying me out the window.

514
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,260
这孩子  真幽默
This guy, he's so funny.

515
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,130
看啊  你脸上有点东西
Look, you have something on your face.

516
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,330
敢乱说话就别指望再见到你的宝贝背包
Play along if you ever want to see your precious backpack.

517
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,130
等等  你变成蝙蝠时
So, wait, you didn't

518
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,370
身上什么衣服都不穿吗
have any clothes on when you were a bat?

519
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,670
还是穿特制蝙蝠衫
Or were they bat-sized?

520
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,510
他到底是谁
Who exactly is that?

521
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,180
小宝贝
Honeybat.

522
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,880
因为你生日
You see, it's your birthday.

523
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,660
我要让你过一个最棒的
And you know I want you to have the bestest,

524
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,550
最特别的生日
specialest party of your life.

525
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,650
所以我需要帮手
So, We... I needed some help.

526
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,250
你还需要帮手
You needed help?

527
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,130
我一个人是没问题  但我想如果由
Look, I am very good, but I thought it would be

528
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,080
和你年龄相仿的人来策划派对
even more bestest, specialest if

529
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,060
就会让这个生日更完美  更特别 
someone closer to your age helped plan the party.

530
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,400
-你和我年龄相仿  -当然
- You're my age? - Sure.

531
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,030
你多大了
How old are you?

532
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,300
118岁
118.

533
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,000
一百多
One hundred and...

534
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,040
是啊  我121岁
Yeah, I'm 121.

535
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
真的吗
Really?

536
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,040
看到了吧  一切都再正常不过了
You see? Everything is very, very normal.

537
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,580
我要办派对  而他来帮忙
I'm throwing a party, and he's helping.

538
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,380
-伯爵  有紧急情况  -等会儿再说 
- Sir, there's an emergency. - Not now.

539
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,720
你没看见我们正在讨论正常的事吗
Can't you see we're in the middle of something very normal here?

540
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,790
等等  到底怎么了
Wait, what's going on here?

541
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,000
你最宝贝的旅馆出现紧急情况
There's an emergency in your precious hotel,

542
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,660
你却没马上跑去处理
and you're not running to fix it?

543
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,090
为什么  是因为他吗
Why? Is it because of him?

544
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,260
看我的表情
Look at my face.

545
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,600
不是  亲爱的  当然不是因为他
No, precious bones, it's not because of him.

546
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,140
很好  那你去处理吧  我来陪他
Good. Then go check on the emergency, and I'll keep him company.

547
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,240
-不行  绝对不行  -什么
- No! Anything but that! - What?

548
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,210
因为他需要时间计划
I mean, because he needs time to plan.

549
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,850
如果你陪他玩  他就没时间策划了
And if you're keeping him company, then he's not planning.

550
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,980
他比较贪玩
He is company-keeping,

551
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,020
该做的事情就没时间做了
and then the plan, it's... It doesn't get planned.

552
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,920
-真能瞎编  -闭嘴
- Good one. - Shut up!

553
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,920
好吧  也许等你策划完我们能一起玩
Okay. So, maybe if you're not planning later, we can hang out.

554
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,430
-好主意  -好的  你听到了吗
- Sounds good. - Yes. You hear that?

555
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,490
他答应了
It sounds good.

556
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,160
你们能出去玩  一会儿见  亲爱的小宝贝
So you will hang out. See you later, my honey. Lovely.

557
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,830
好了  你不能跟她玩
Okay, you're not hanging out.

558
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,870
因为你要走了
Because you are leaving.

559
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,840
可你刚刚答应她了
But the opposite, you said.

560
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,380
伯爵  紧急情况还没处理
But, sir, the emergency.

561
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,610
跟我来
Follow me.

562
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,320
天啊  这孩子熏死人了
Boy, that kid smelt.

563
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,020
我们要去哪儿
Where are we going?

564
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,660
走秘密通道把你赶出去
Just getting rid of you

565
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,390
这样她就看不见我们了
through a secret tunnel so she does not see us.

566
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,960
我能问你个问题吗
So, can I ask you a question?

567
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,330
你真的怕大蒜吗
Is that real, about the garlic thing?

568
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,440
是啊  我不能吃  吃了嗓子会肿  
Yes, I cannot have it. My throat swells.

569
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,170
那用木桩钉心脏呢
Wooden stake to the heart?

570
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,470
也怕  那样谁都会死  
Yeah, who wouldn't that kill?

571
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,120
到了
Here we go.

572
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,260
抱歉  我有点迷路
I'm sorry. I'm a little lost.

573
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,730
我知道你们在度蜜月  抱歉
Yes, I know it's your honeymoon. I apologize.

574
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,530
你们继续
Go back to doing what you were doing.

575
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,640
我不常下来
I'm not down here much.

576
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,510
这里是人类入侵时的紧急出口
It's meant to be an exit if humans ever invade.

577
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,730
这么说  我是第一个来这里的人类
So, I'm, like, the first human here? 

578
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,640
太酷了
That's really cool.

579
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,510
我的天啊
Oh, boy.

580
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,310
可算找到了
I think this is it.

581
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,650
-出了什么事  -我非常抱歉
- What's happening? - I'm terribly sorry.

582
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,750
-是我的错  -你们到底想干什么  
- My mistake. - What is wrong with you people?

583
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,830
这地方棒极了
This place is amazing.

584
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,190
行了  你就别废话了
Okay, I could really use some silence right now.

585
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,100
好了  第三次应该成功了
All right, third time's a...

586
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,380
德库拉
Drac.

587
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,680
是我  弗兰克
Yes, Frankie?

588
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,880
哥们儿  你来干嘛
Buddy, what you been doing?

589
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
站着别动
Don't move.

590
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,420
没什么事  你们在干什么
Never mind that. What you been doing?

591
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,490
我们在为梅维斯的派对排练节目
We wanted to practice our big number for Mavis's party,

592
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,260
这帮废物就霸着演奏台不放了
and then these losers wouldn't get off the bandstand.

593
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,090
好了  赶快把僵尸莫扎特
Okay. Put down Zombie Mozart,

594
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,360
巴赫和贝多芬放下
Bach and Beethoven this instant.

595
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,200
僵尸贝多芬  你排练了吗
Did you get to rehearse at all, Zombie Beethoven?

596
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,040
德库拉  我们想怀旧一番  表演些老节目
Listen, Drac, we wanted to play something, like old times.

597
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,740
我们甚至想让你和我们合唱
We even thought maybe you'd sing with us.

598
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,350
得了  伙计们  你们知道
Come on, fellas. You know

599
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,110
自从玛莎去世后  我就再没当众表演过
that I haven't sung in public since Martha.

600
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,050
是啊  但我们想  
Yeah, but we just thought how much,

601
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,850
梅维斯一定会非常喜欢的
you know, Mavis would love it.

602
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,080
我说不行
I said no!

603
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,290
别再问我了
Don't ask me again!

604
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,420
好了  拥抱一下僵尸们  大家和好吧
Okay. Now, let's hug the zombies. Let's all make up.

605
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,760
-他真的吓着你了吧  -我不害怕
- He really scared you. - I wasn't scared.

606
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,960
我不过是表示礼貌  懂吗
I was being polite, okay?

607
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,930
你在这里干嘛  我以为你在策划派对
What are you doing here? I thought you were planning.

608
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,330
我还不知道你的名字
I never caught your name.

609
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,600
我叫梅维斯
My name's Mavis.

610
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,240
梅维斯  这名字真好听
Mavis? That's a pretty neat name.

611
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,340
是啊  是我妈妈起的
Yeah, my mom picked it.

612
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,480
那你叫什么名字呢
So, are you going to tell me your name?

613
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,480
我  我的名字  问得好
Me? My name? Good question.

614
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,710
显然  我是弗兰克斯坦
Obviously, I'm Frankenstein.

615
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,280
不可能  弗兰克斯坦是我叔叔  就在那边
No, you're not. Frankenstein is my uncle over there.

616
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,120
正在拥抱僵尸莫扎特
The gentleman hugging Zombie Mozart.

617
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,060
是啊  当然  他是你叔叔
Right. Of course, he's your uncle.

618
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,190
我不是那个弗兰克斯坦
See, I'm not "The" Frankenstein.

619
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,830
我是他表弟  强尼斯坦
I'm his cousin, Johnnystein.

620
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,230
-强尼斯坦  -梅维斯
- Johnnystein? - Mavis.

621
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,640
那是谁
Who is that?

622
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,370
这些怪物会杀了我吗
Are these monsters going to kill me?

623
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,240
只要他们认为你是同类就不会杀你
Not as long as they think you're a monster.

624
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,780
简直是种族歧视
That's kind of racist.

625
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,110
这个咱们回头再聊
We'll talk later.

626
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,420
-他这是取笑我吗  -不  不
- Is he making fun of me? - No, no.

627
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,550
他当然不是  因为他是
Of course he's not, because he's...

628
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,220
你的表弟  强尼斯坦
he's your cousin, Johnnystein.

629
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,090
是啊  没错
Yes, yes, yes.

630
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,790
我没有表兄弟
I don't have no cousin.

631
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,630
不不  你有  他是你三代以外的第六位表弟  
No, no, you do. He's your sixth cousin, three times removed.

632
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,730
是你右手那边的亲戚
On your right arm's side.

633
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,130
你还有个表弟
You have a cousin?

634
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,700
弗兰克  如果你的手臂能说话
Frank, if your arm could talk,

635
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,740
他会告诉你  
he would tell you that the

636
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,370
你手臂的原始主人有位兄弟
original owner of your arm had a brother.

637
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,940
他娶了一个女人
Who married a woman.

638
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,210
他杀死了一头猪
Who was... for strangling a pig.

639
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,440
我的胳膊里有杀猪的血统吗
I have pig-strangling blood in my arm?

640
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,640
感觉真酷
That's kind of cool.

641
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,410
表弟  很高兴见到你
Cuz, great to meet you.

642
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,350
什么风把你吹来了  强尼
So, what brings you here, Johnny?

643
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,880
-那是什么  -抱歉
- What was that? - Sorry.

644
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,220
我说话前应该清清喉咙弄点动静出来
I should really clear my throat before I speak.

645
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,790
什么风把你吹来了
Anyway, what brings you here?

646
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,120
我是派对策划人
Party planner.

647
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,920
没错  是我聘请
Yes, I have recruited Mr.

等一下  你请人帮忙
Wait a minute, you asked someone to help you?

650

你可是出名的控制狂
Captain Control Freak?

651

我是伯爵
It's Count...

652
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,800
没错  我觉得请个和梅维斯同龄的人会更好
And yes, I thought having a Mavis contemporary would be useful.

653
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,840
是啊  他确实需要点新思路
Yeah, he totally needed a fresher perspective.

654
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,210
好了  强尼  那位老古董先生
Okay, Johnny, Mr. Tight Coffin over here

00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,450
正打算让这群废物在派对上表演呢
was planning to have these powdered lame-os play at the party.

656
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,720
不管怎样  我们觉得可以让场面生动一点
So, anyways, we thought we could liven things up a bit.

657
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,590

00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,650
大家稍等一下

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,520
手  电影
Hands? Film.

702
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,460
呕吐  呕吐物
Vomit. The Vomit?

703
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,260
-呕吐  -这个不是让你们猜的
- The Throw Up. - No. That wasn't a clue.

704
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,240
空无一物
Nothing?

705
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,140
空虚  眼镜 
Emptiness? Glasses?

706
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,610
眼镜  晃眼镜
Glasses? Glasses shaking?

707
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,340
眼镜斜着晃
Glasses shaking sideways!

708
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,340
透过眼镜看
Through The Looking-Glass?

709
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,780
猜得我都恶心了
I stink at this.

710
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,610
不是我吃的
I didn't do that.

711
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,320
手收回  举臂  向前推
And pull it back. And up. And push.

712
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,690
转体  收回
And twist. And back.

713
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,950
举臂  收回
And up. And twist.

714
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,090
向前推
And push.

715
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,760
不  这个别学
No. Don't copy that.

716
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,800
收回  举臂  转体
And back. And up. And twist.

717
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,400
我要一个淋巴腺麋鹿鼻子蛋卷
Let me get a bubonic moose nose omelet

718
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,570
要加蟑螂酱和老鼠果冻
with cockroach paste and mouse jelly.

719
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,080
加蛋清
And with egg whites.

720
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,050
早安  德库拉先生
Bonjour, Monsieur Dracula!

721
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,610
要给您做个蛋卷吗
May I make you an omelet?

722
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,080
不  不用  我不饿
No, no, no, no. I'm not hungry.

723
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,420
什么  艾斯梅拉达  你又闻见人类的味道了 
What? Esmeralda, you smell it again?

724
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,890
-人类  -我饿了
- Human? - I am hungry.

725
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,230
强尼  你去过泰姬陵吗
Johnny, you've been to the Taj Mahal?

726
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,730
算了吧  没有怪物能去泰姬陵
Come on. No monster's been to the Taj.

727
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,330
真希望我能去看看
Man, I wish I could go there.

728
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,900
告诉你  我要吃50个蛋卷
You know what? I'll take 50 omelets.

729
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,800
听见了吧  快做
You heard the man! Make them!

730
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,870
如果被人群围堵怎么办
How did you deal with the mobs?

731
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,070
是啊  夏天的确人超级多
Yeah, it does get pretty crazy in the summer.

732
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,040
随机应变就好啦
But, you know, you just got to roll.

733
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,450
他能随机应变  真酷
He just rolls. That's cool that he rolls.

734
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,350
是呀  是呀  真酷
Yes, yes, cool.

735
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,050
宝贝  我给你拿了
Look, love droppings, I brought

736
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,590
你最爱吃的尖叫奶酪面包圈
you a bagel with your favorite scream cheese.

737
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,320
太棒了  谢谢  老爸
Holy rabies. Thanks, Dad.

738
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,860
强尼  你也尝尝尖叫奶酪吧  超好吃
Johnny, try some scream cheese, it's awesome.

739
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,290
真酷
Cool.

740
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,260
但我对这东西过敏  还是你吃吧
But I'm scream cheese intolerant. So, polite pass.

741
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,960
对  你会过敏
Yes, of course you are.

742
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,270
强尼  我们讨论一下派对的事情吧
Johnny, can we party-plan talk for a minute?

743
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,830
你干什么
What are you doing?

744
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,770
如果他们发现你是人类  就乱套了
If they find out you are human, they'll go bat poop!

745
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,540
别担心  没人怀疑
Relax. No one suspects anything.

746
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,320
你老是这样给我说悄悄话
The only thing that looks

747
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,640
不让人怀疑才怪
weird is how much whispering you're doing.

748
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,380
那你就快点走人
Just wrap it up.

749
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,480
就说你想去游泳  表现得兴高采烈一点
You will say you are going in the pool and act excited.

750
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,550
假装不小心闪着腰了  然后离开这里
And then you will say you hurt your back and you have to leave.

751
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,690
大家来欢乐一下吧
Here come good times!

752
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,260
哎哟  我的背
Oh, dudes. Oh, my back.

753
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,860
我这就让你背
I'm on your back!

754
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,730
不  不  他是说  我的背
No, no. He said, "Oh, my back."

755
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,230
-跳我背上来  -来吧
- Get on my back! - Let's do it.

756
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,300
来啦  骑马打仗  放倒他们
Here we go. Chicken fight! Push them off!

757
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,470
骑马打仗
Chicken fight!

758
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,740
你跑不了  强尼
We got you, Johnny.

759
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,340
你死定了
You're going down.

760
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,140
看谁厉害  小梅
Oh, yeah, we'll see, "Mavey Wavey."

761
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,910
停  别玩儿骑马打仗了
Okay, calm down with the fight chickens!

762
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,050
大家都停下来  别闹了
Everyone, stop the roughhousing!

763
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,120
弗兰克  你要是摔伤了
Frank, if you hurt yourself...

764
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,930
别担心  亲爱的
I got it, honey.

765
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,360
科学怪人天生就是玩儿这个的
The Stein boys are bred for this kind of thing.

766
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,800
杰罗尼莫
Geronimo!

767
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,800
{\an8}伞兵跳伞时的呐喊

768
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,940
小兔崽子  你们干嘛脱他内裤
Kids, why'd you do that?

769
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,980
我刚从游泳池出来
I was just in the pool.

770
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,150
水冷死了
The water's cold.

771
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,480
别笑我
Don't judge me!

772
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,050
强尼  妆掉了
Johnny. Your makeup.

773
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,890
妆掉了
Your makeup!

774
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,920
快给我出来
Climb out. Now.

775
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,230
不是吧
Oh, man.

776
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,530
原来伯爵也想游一圈呀
I guess the Count wanted to go for a swim.

777
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,940
深水炸弹
Cannonball!

778
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,600
小子  都给你搞砸了  弄得乱七八糟
Oh, you messed up, baby. You messed up big-time.

779
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,770
我让你消停点
I told you to take it down.

780
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,680
要被他们发现还不把我家给拆了
You'll ruin my hotel if they find out.

781
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,110
我看你是嫉妒吧
Well, maybe you're just jealous

782
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,680
看大家玩儿得这么开心
that people are finally having fun at this place.

783
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,450
是吗  那就叫开心吗
Oh, that? That was not fun.

784
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,300
大家都跟疯子似的跑来跑去
Everyone running,

785
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,620
上窜下跳  乱游一气
jumping, swimming with no order.

786
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,120
那才不叫开心
That was the opposite of fun.

787
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,720
你知道什么是开心吗
Do you even know what fun is?

788
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,590
开心是我发明的
I invented fun!

789
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,290
老天  怎么这么无聊的人会长生不死
Boy, the wrong people get to be immortal.

790
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,630
看着我的眼睛
Look at me.

791
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,330
忘记你在这里的所见所闻
You remember nothing of this encounter.

792
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:49,800
抹掉在这里的一切记忆
You have no memory of this place or the monsters you met.

793
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,840
离开这里  永远不要再回来
Now go and never return.

794
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,780
等一下  再也不能回到这个城堡吗
Wait, never return to the hotel?

795
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,150
怎么回事  你本该忘掉这个城堡的
What? You were supposed to forget the hotel.

796
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,280
我在用魔法消除你的记忆
I just used my powers to erase your memory.

797
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,020
我直视你的眼睛
I looked straight into your eyes.

798
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,190
或许是因为我带了隐形眼镜吧
Oh, maybe it's the contact lenses.

799
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,190
什么东西  
The what?

800
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,390
就是有这个塑料小玩意儿我才能看清
These little plasticky doodads that help me see better.

801
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,790
我给你摘下来看看
Here, let me just try and get them out real quick.

802
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,390
我从没看过这么恶心的东西
Oh, that is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen!

803
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,880
就快拿下来了
Almost got it.

804
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,360
别拿了  别拿了
Stop doing that. Please stop doing that!

805
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,830
手指头离眼珠子远点  够了
Fingers away from the eyeballs! Enough!

806
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,340
听好了  你再也不许来这儿
Listen to me. You are never to return here.

807
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,140
离这远远的  不许对任何人提起
You are to stay away and never tell humans about this place.

808
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,910
否则我会找到你  吸干你的血
Or I will track you down and suck every ounce of blood

809
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,820
就像一个泄了气的橡皮垫子
from your body until you look like a deflated whoopee cushion!

810
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,820
快走
Be gone.

811
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,830
真不相信我就要走了  多好玩的地方
Can't believe I'm leaving, man. That could have been so great!

812
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,900
那家伙真扫兴  说什么吸干我的血
Dude ruined everything. Suck my blood.

813
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,740
我当时应该说  我就不走  老顽固
I should have just said, "I'm staying, old man!"

814
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,010
给他一记李小龙式的回旋踢  直接踢中
Give him a Bruce Lee kick. Boom! Right in the...

815
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,040
我的妈呀  德库拉伯爵
Oh, my God. Count Dracula.

816
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,910
求求你别杀我  我这就走  这就走
Please don't kill me. I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

817
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:05,840
跟我来
Follow me.

818
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,530
不行  梅维斯  我不能跟你走
Oh. No, no, Mavis, I can't.

819
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,520
我得马上离开这儿
I have to leave.

820
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,790
-真要走吗  会很好玩哦  -好吧
- You sure? It'll be fun. - Okay.

821
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,400
他不会发现我吧
He's not gonna see me, is he?

822
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,620
你不来看看这里的风景吗
Wow, would you look at the view from up here?

823
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,340
都快能看到布达佩斯了
You could almost see Budapest.

824
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:44,340
{\an8}匈牙利首都

825
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:44,920
忽达佩斯
Who-da-pest?

826
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,460
离夏威尼近吗
Is that near Ha-wi-fi?

827
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,030
你是说夏威夷吧  是啊  那里美翻了
Huh? Oh, you mean Hawaii. Yeah, that place is a knockout.

828
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,890
我前不久刚去过那里的一个音乐狂欢节
I just went to a music festival there.

829
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,830
人类的音乐狂欢节
A human music festival?

830
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,330
我想是的吧
Uh, I believe so.

831
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,370
那他们有没有咬你脚趾头
So, did they all bite your toes

832
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,000
还往你脸上扔蒜蓉面包呀
and shove garlic bread in your face?

833
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,240
没有  不过  有个家伙把我的
No. Well, one dude took a bigger bite

834
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,870
能量棒咬去一大口
out of my energy bar than I expected,

835
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,240
但我不怪他  是氛围太热烈了
but I blame that on the heat.

836
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,980
真好  你什么地方都去过
It's amazing. You've been everywhere.

837
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,480
不出去转转能怎样呢
Well, you know, what's the alternative?

838
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,420
无非宅在家里  大门不出二门不迈  
Just staying at home, never exploring,

839
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,950
外面发生了什么都一无所知
never seeing what's out there?

840
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,330
一辈子也就一个121岁  不是吗
I'm only gonna be 121 once, right?

841
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,750
要活得带劲一点
Got to live it.

842
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,190
是呀
Yeah.

843
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:28,200
天呐  这里的日出肯定美翻了
Oh, man. The sunrise from here must be amaz... Ow.

844
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,100
抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

845
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,770
你从来没看过日出  是吗
Man, you've probably never even seen a sunrise, have you?

846
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,000
没有  没看过  怎么了
No, not really. Why?

847
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,200
跟我来  我有个主意
Come on. I have an idea.

848
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,340
看吧
Watch.

849
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,440
我跟你们说过在这儿很享受吧
Didn't I tell you guys we'd have fun in here?

850
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,370
最舒服了不是吗
Is this not the best?

851
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,840
是呀  我出了一身汗
Yeah, I'm working up a nice sweat.

852
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,110
强尼那小子什么时候把派对策划好
When's that Johnny kid gonna be done party planning?

853
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,550
-他真有意思  -他就是个小怪兽
- He's a great hang. - Yeah, he's an animal.

854
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,540
看到梅维斯和他那么投缘
And it was so nice seeing

855
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,250
真是温馨
Mavis laughing and hitting it off with him.

856
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,120
什么投缘  拜托
Who's hitting what off? Please.

857
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,260
梅维斯才不会喜欢他这样的呢
Mavis could never be with someone of his kind.

858
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,060
什么意思  他这种
I'm sorry? "His kind"?

859
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,000
你是说我们科学怪人配不上你们吗
You're saying our kind's not good enough for you,

860
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,900
伯爵大人
"Your Lordship"?

861
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,070
不  不  不  弗兰克
No, no, no! Frank,

862
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,870
我不是  我是说她才不会
I didn't... I meant that she wouldn't

863
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,910
喜欢红毛卷发的家伙呢
be into someone with such red, curly hair.

864
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,040
红毛卷发怎么了
Uh, what's wrong with red, curly hair?

865
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,510
你生哪门子气
Why are you getting upset?

866
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,650
我就是红毛卷发
I have red curly hair!

867
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,280
那我怎么知道
Well, how was I supposed to know that?

868
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,870
这是我见过的最美的风景
This is the most incredible thing I've ever seen.

869
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,670
强尼
Johnny?

870
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,170
冷静点  伙计们
Look, settle down, fellas.

871
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,070
强尼人都走了  说这些也没意义
This is all a moot point because Johnny, he left.

872
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,840
等等  他走了
Wait a minute. He left?

873
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,840
是的  他说他不喜欢梅维斯
Yes. He decided he didn't like Mavis,

874
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,540
也不喜欢我们
or any of us.

875
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,420
我想强尼改变主意了
Hmm. I guess Johnny had second thoughts.

876
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,200
你竟然敢回来  你是不是没听清楚  
I can't believe you stuck around, man. You don't get it.

877
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,430
你惨了
Bad things are coming your way.

878
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,500
集中精力
I got to get my thoughts together.

879
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,940
好吧
Okay.

880
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,670
看到那些桌子了
You see these tables?

881
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,380
把它们拉出来摆好  你今天就干这个吧
You can spend the entire day pulling them out

882
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,480
派对策划者
and placing them, party planner.

883
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,650
真英明  把我困在这里
Fantastic. I'm trapped here.

884
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,380
我算是理解你女儿了
Now I know how your daughter feels.

885
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,060
够了  够了  停
Enough! Enough! Stop!

886
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,660
去墙角  面壁思过
Go to a corner, you're in a timeout!

887
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,530
面壁思过  我不是小孩子
Timeout? I'm a grown man!

888
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,870
好啦  57号桌  去23号位置
Okay. Table 57, please move to position 23.

889
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,350
-太酷了  -面壁
- That is cool. - Face the wall.

890
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:37,120
17到48  16到47  19到50
17 to 48. 16 to 47. 19 to 50.

891
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,090
-帅呆了  -别打扰我
- Awesomeness. - Just let me do my work.

00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,990
29到35

17  18  19  20  21  22  23
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

895
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,660
39到24
39 to 24.

896
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,030
36起

897
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,500
29到35

00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,690
7到25  14到30
7 to 25. 14 to 30.

901
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,460
你哪去了  老爷子
Where'd you go, grandpa?

902
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,230
别吓傻了  小白脸
Don't freak out, gravity face.

903
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,830
追着我屁股跑吧  大尖牙
Eat my dust, gray fangs!

904
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,600
56和43  左右护卫
56 and 43, to my side.

905
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,050
准备受虐吧  背包小子
Prepare to cry, Billy Backpack.

906
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,660
来吧  你抓不到我
That's how we do it! Half-pipe, baby!

907
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,460
走着瞧
Whatever.

908
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,060
对  继续追踪
Yes. Keep smelling.

909
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:59,700
抓到他  我就可以做人肉馅饼了
You catch the human, and then I will make human potpie!

910
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,510
27  45  65  76  48
27, 45, 65, 76, 48,

911
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,240
堵住他的路
block his path.

912
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,410
堵住他的路
Block his path!

913
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,820
你小子可以呀
Oh, come on now, dude man!

914
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,620
有两下子
Nice!

915
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,360
我来救你了  老兄
I got you, buddy.

916
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,870
小点声
Do not disturb!

917
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:34,800
人家睡觉呢
People trying to sleep here!

918
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,550
你看见没
Did you see that?

919
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:52,550
看见那家伙了吗  零件先生
Who is that guy, Sir Breaks-a-lot?

920
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,790
天呐  我不得不说  太有趣了
Oh, boy, I have to say, that was fun. Okay?

921
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,730
你之前不是说有趣吗  说对了
The fun you were talking about earlier? Nailed it!

922
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,330
强尼
Johnny?

923
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,570
加西莫多[钟楼怪人]
Quasimodo!

924
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,390
梅维斯  怎么还没睡
Mavis? Why are you still up?

925
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,170
太阳都出来了
The sun is out.

926
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,350
阳光会灼伤你的  我的小宝贝
It could kill you, my honeyguts.

927
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,290
我睡不着  你知道强尼去哪儿了吗
I couldn't sleep. Do you know where Johnny went?

928
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,020
我不知道  他
I don't know. He...

929
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,190
你为什么这么关心
Why do you want to know?

930
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,430
-你喜欢他吗  -说什么呢
- Do you like him? - What?

931
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,550
才不呢  拜托  老爸
Pfft, no. Come on, Dad.

932
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:34,800
他横冲直撞  呆头呆脑的
He's so weird and awkward.

933
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,600
你这个白痴你不知道你很可爱吗
It's like, are you an idiot or do you know you're adorable?

934
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,770
稍等
Eh... Hold that.

935
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,540
知道加西莫多在哪吗
Do you have a location on Quasimodo?

936
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,210
知道  伯爵
Yes, sir.

937
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,510
他们穿过大厅  去厨房了
They're heading through the lobby, towards the kitchen.

938
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,980
立即阻止他们
I need them stopped immediately.

939
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,640
-听清楚了吗  -听清楚了
- Is that clear? - Yes, quite.

940
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,850
我们这就去
We are on it.

941
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,790
抓不着
Ha-ha! Missed!

942
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,860
你们什么意思  让我过去
What is the meaning of this? Let me pass!

943
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,430
加西莫多·威尔逊  跟我们走一趟
Quasimodo Wilson, you are coming with us.

944
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,200
我为什么会痛
Why did that hurt me?

945
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,810
宝贝  你这个年龄不适合谈恋爱
Look, honey, there's no falling in love at your age.

946
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:19,860
妈妈就是我这么大恋爱的
Mom was my age.

947
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,080
尤妮斯说是妈妈主动亲的你
Eunice says Mom kissed you first,

948
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,180
因为你胆小不敢主动
'cause you were too scared to make the first move.

949
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,710
是  是  是  是  是
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,110
先不说我和你妈的初吻
Forget about me and Mom and kissing.

951
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,950
老爸  总有一天  我也要结婚
Dad, at some point, I'm going to get married.

952
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,540
我不可能在这儿待一辈子
I can't be here forever.

953
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,520
什么  为什么不
What? Why not?

954
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,260
你才刚换了牙
You're barely out of your training fangs.

955
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,890
我又赢了
Quasi wins again!

956
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,960
敢跟我作对  把你们摔个屁滚尿流
When you bump with the hump, you land on your rump!

957
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,670
怎么突然感兴趣了呢
But why all the sudden interest?

958
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,240
每次我们说这个话题  你总说
Every time we used to talk about love, it was always,

959
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,480
老爸  你真讨厌
"Ooh, Dad, that's gross,"

960
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,080
要么就是  老爸  我不想聊这个
and "Ooh, Dad, I don't want to know about that."

961
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,210
我不知道
I don't know.

962
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,750
伯爵  他到厨房了
Sir, he made it into the kitchen.

963
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,180
你说什么
He what?

964
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,680
我花钱要你干什么吃的
What do I pay you for?

965
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,550
抱歉  宝贝  我得走了
I'm sorry, honey. I have to go.

966
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,820
他才没花钱
He doesn't pay me.

967
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:47,960
杀我之前
Before you kill me,

968
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,600
能不能让我再看我的背包最后一眼
can I please talk to my backpack one more time?

969
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,670
我不想留下遗憾
I don't want to leave anything unresolved.

970
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,100
你好啊  德库拉先生
Bonjour, Monsieur Dracula!

971
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,540
闭上你的臭嘴
Shut your hump hole.

972
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,170
你是要救他吗
Now you are helping him?

973
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,340
你为什么要护着人类
What is it with you and this human?

974
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,640
他不是人类  是科学怪人一族
He is not human. He's a Stein!

975
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,080
没错  矮冬瓜  我是科学怪人一族
That's right, little man, I'm a Stein!

976
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,390
如果他真是怪兽
If he is a monster,

977
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,580
让他吓唬艾斯梅拉达试试
let him scare Esmeralda!

978
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,480
那只老鼠吗
The mouse?

979
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,390
这还不好说
Without a doubt.

980
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,620
等着瞧吧
Okay. Here we go.

981
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,540
有人类  有人类
A human! A human!

982
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,640
德库拉先生把人类放进来了
Monsieur Dracula has brought a human into the...

983
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:40,010
艾斯梅拉达  救我
Esmeralda, help me.

984
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,090
谢谢你救了我
Hey, thanks for saving me back there.

985
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,300
那家伙真是疯子  竟然想吃了我
That guy's crazy! Trying to eat me.

986
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,190
这种事之前就遇到过一次
That's only happened to me one other time.

987
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,900
在活结乐队的一场演唱会上
This weird dude at a Slipknot concert.

988
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,300
我要给你看样东西
There's something I need to show you.

989
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,380
难道是让我参加葬礼吗
Hey, are we at a funeral right now?

990
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,650
不对  不  这是你的床
Oh, wait, no, it's your bed.

991
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,460
真是酷毙了
So creepy and cool.

992
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,830
我知道她
Wow! I know her!

993
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,360
我在卢波遗址见过这幅画
I've seen that picture at the ruins of Lubov.

994
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,830
那是我最爱的城堡
That's my favorite castle.

995
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,670
还有一个关于她的传说
There's a whole legend around that lady.

996
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:32,630
传说
A legend?

997
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,700
卢波魅影
The Lady Lubov.

998
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,910
传说有个孤独的伯爵跟她偶然相遇
The story is that a lonely Count met her by chance,

999
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:42,080
他们发现彼此
and they say that no two souls

1000
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,480
就是对方命中注定的另一半
were ever more meat for each other.

1001
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,150
最后他们在卢波定居下来
Eventually, they settld down at Castle Lubov

1002
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,150
还有了个孩子
and had a child.

1003
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:52,150
好景不长  灾难来临了
But then, a horre tragedy happened.

1004
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:55,990
他们在一场神秘的大火中丧生
A fire started mysteriouy one night, and it killed both of them.

1005
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:04,100
当我置身城堡  仍能感到那股爱的力量
When I was at the castle, I could still feel their powerful love.

1006
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,600
就像人们说的那样
They say it's as if a soul

1007
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,970
似乎有灵魂萦绕着城堡
is still trapped in the ruins themselves.

1008
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,540
传说是错的
The legend is wrong.

1009
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,980
只有那个妻子死了
It was only the wife that died.

1010
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,460
杀死她的不是什么神秘大火
And it was no mystery who killed her.

1011
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:33,090
而是你们人类
She was killed by your kind!

1012
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,100
吸血鬼
Vampire!

1013
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,280
亲爱的
Honey?

1014
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,700
快躲起来  我来对付他们
Go hide. I'll take care of this.

1015
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,640
吸血鬼
Vampire!

1016
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,880
玛莎
Martha!

1017
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,510
他们才是怪物
They are the real monster.

1018
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,040
我为我的爱人建造了这个城堡
I built this place for my love,

1019
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,760
来保护我们的孩子
to protect her child.

1020
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,670
一个父亲会尽其所能保护他的家人
As a father, you do everything to keep your family safe,

1021
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,470
即便不得已欺骗他们
even if you have to break their trust.

1022
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:19,870
但是  梅维斯喜欢你
But now, Mavis has feelings for you.

1023
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,070
什么
What?

1024
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,980
我真
I just...

1025
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,410
-太好了  -没关系
- Awesome. - It's all right.

1026
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,620
你很善良
You are a good one.

1027
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,820
如果世界不是这个样子  或许还有可能
If the world was different, maybe it would be possible.

1028
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,720
德库拉  现在是二十一世纪了
Drac, this is the 21st century.

1029
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,190
人们已经不是过去的样子了
People aren't the same as they were back then.

1030
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:40,260
你敢保证  如果我们身份暴露
Can you tell me for certain that if we came out in the open,

1031
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,500
所有人都能接受我们吗
everyone would accept us?

1032
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,660
所有人
Everyone?

1033
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,140
不  你是对的
No. You're right.

1034
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,170
这次我会永远离开
I'll go for good this time.

1035
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,710
你就说我有急事
You can just say I had some emergency,

1036
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,180
或是被鬼精灵吃掉了
or the gremlin lady ate me or something.

1037
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,010
不  不  不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no.

1038
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:00,880
我不想把她的生日派对搞砸
I don't want to ruin her birthday party.

1039
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,880
等派对一结束  你悄悄离开就好
You can sneak out after it's all done.

1040
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,590
对不起
I'm sorry.

1041
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,590
我不想伤害她
The last thing I wanted was to hurt her.

1042
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,790
也不想伤害你
Or you.

1043
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,130
知道吗  你或许装不了最棒的科学怪人
You know, you're not the smoothest Frankenstein,

1044
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,500
但绝对能扮个完美的吸血鬼
but you'd make a great vampire.

1045
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,970
真的吗
For real?

1046
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,840
因为我也觉得能模仿你的记忆催眠
'Cause I think I kind of got your hypno-eyes down.

1047
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,400
你小子又来了  快试试看
Oh, boy, here we go. Let me see it.

1048
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,880
当心  你已经被我控制
Beware! For you are in my power.

1049
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,140
我命令你变成狼人
I command you to be the werewolf man!

1050
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,950
我孩子太多了
I have too many kids.

1051
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:38,220
他们老搔我  都长虱子了
Someone scratch me, I have fleas.

1052
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,720
狼人嘛  都长虱子
'Cause he's a wolf, he'd get those.

1053
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,460
是吧  不  不能多嘴
Yeah, no, don't explain it.

1054
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,830
一解释就不好玩儿了
It's not funny when you do that.

1055
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,220
我不需要叫醒服务
I didn't order a wake-up call.

1056
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,920
德库拉伯爵为每个房间都安排了
Count Dracula arranged it for all the rooms.

1057
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,790
怎么关掉
Where's the snooze button?

1058
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,620
关不掉  今天有派对
There will be no snoozing. The party's today.

1059
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,650
真舒服呀
Ooh, yeah, perfecto.

1060
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,100
宝贝
Girl

1061
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,230
真不敢相信终于等到今天
I can't believe it's your big night

1062
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,770
青蛙是你的大餐  派对为你而办
You ate your frogs, now the party's so right

1063
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,070
时间悄悄溜走  宝贝
Where did the time go, girl?

1064
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,380
宝贝  曾经的你天真纯白
And, girl, you used to suck a binky

1065
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,350
如今婷婷玉立
Look at you now

1066
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,690
尽情享受牛血的新鲜
You're sucking blood right out of the cow

1067
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,890
你真美
You look beautiful.

1068
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,190
谢谢  谢谢你办的派对
Thanks. Thanks for the party.

1069
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,000
是吗  你喜欢这样的场景吗
Yeah, you like my little touches?

1070
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
{\an8}巴黎  

1071
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
{\an8}纽约  第五大道  中央公园

1072
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
{\an8}莫斯科

1073
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
{\an8}夏威夷

1074
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,650
太赞了
It's amazing.

1075
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,190
派对太棒了
Terrific party.

1076
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,530
真让我刮目相看  德库拉
You really outdid yourself, Drac.

1077
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,230
这是五百年来我参加过的最好的派对
Got to be the best one I've been to in 500 years.

1078
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,180
对不起  大块头
Sorry, big man.

1079
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,500
梅维斯
Mavis?

1080
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,370
说实话我真的很害怕
I'm crazily scared right now.

1081
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,410
或许会很美妙呢
Maybe that's a good thing.

1082
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,250
你怎么能这样  我的血泪史白跟你讲了
How could you? After I shared my pain with you?

1083
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,160
-但是  不  -爸爸  只是接吻而已
- But, no... - Dad, it was just a kiss.

1084
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,790
不行  不许接吻
No, you're not allowed to kiss.

1085
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,810
爸爸  我有我的自由
Dad, I'm allowed to do things.

1086
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,500
我不是八十三岁小孩了
I'm not 83 anymore.

1087
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,600
我可以自由恋爱  可以去外面自由闯荡
I'm allowed to like people, or go see the world again.

1088
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,260
什么  你都看见了
What? You saw it!

1089
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,470
你不是很失望吗
You said you didn't like it!

1090
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,440
那只是第一印象而已
Maybe I want to give the village another chance.

1091
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,620
我需要学习适应
I just need to learn, you know,

1092
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,270
像强尼那样  学会随机应变
just how to roll with it, like Johnny does.

1093
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,310
不  不行  不许你再去那儿
No, no, you can't go to the village again.

1094
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,710
或许能让他们明白  我们可以做朋友
Maybe you can make them see that we could be friends.

1095
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,710
不  不可能
No, that isn't possible.

1096
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,810
你怎么知道  这完全取决于自己的态度
Well, you can't be sure. It's all in how you present yourself.

1097
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,170
没用  不会有什么两样
No, that won't make a difference!

1098
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:28,780
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1099
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,380
因为就是不会
Because it just won't!

1100
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,120
为什么  为什么不会
Why? Why won't it?

1101
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,250
因为那个地方根本不存在
Because that village doesn't really exist!

1102
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,290
你说不存在是什么意思
What do you mean "Doesn't exist"?

1103
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,000
你干什么了
What did you do?

1104
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,430
我做了身为父亲应该做的
I did what I had to do.

1105
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,030
你做了什么
What was it?

1106
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,140
你到底做了什么必须做的事  告诉我
What exactly did you have to do? Tell me!

1107
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:56,580
我建了那个小村  员工们一起建的
I... I built the town. The staff put it all together.

1108
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:00,410
僵尸们化妆成村民
The zombies dressed up as the townspeople.

1109
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,850
对不起  我...
Please. I...

1110
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:08,120
如果你真的出去了  发生什么不测
If you really went out there and something happened to you,

1111
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,960
我没法原谅自己
I just couldn't live with myself.

1112
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,400
那这样就可以了吗  对我说谎  耍我
But you can live with this? Lying to me? Tricking me?

1113
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,830
即使知道我梦想着走出去
Keeping me here forever

1114
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:18,000
却仍然把我困在这里
when you knew my dream was to go.

1115
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,570
骗子  骗子
Liar! Liar!

1116
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,070
要油吗
Oil?

1117
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,980
说英语  拜托
English, please.

1118
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,080
你的声音真闹心
Your voice is really annoying.

1119
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,910
等等  我会说冰语
Wait, I speak frozen.

1120
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,380
他说德库拉把一个人类带进了旅社
He says, "Dracula has brought a human into the hotel."

1121
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,550
-人类  -抱紧我  甜心
- A human? - Stay close, Pookie!

1122
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,660
他说  这里有一个人类
He says, "There is ze human."

1123
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,060
他有点法国口音
He has a French accent.

1124
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:54,500
强尼不是人类  他说我右手的堂弟
Johnny's not a human. He's my right arm's cousin.

1125
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,900
-他在说谎  -对
- He's lying. - Yeah.

1126
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:57,840
话说回来  他为什么要插自己的鼻子
And why is he picking his nose?

1127
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,310
他说  说来话长
He says, "It's a long story."

1128
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,380
等等  不  别缠着我
Hey, wait, no! Get off me!

1129
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,520
他说  亲眼所见是个人类
He says, "Behold ze human."

1130
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,250
我不相信
I don't believe it.

1131
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,860
真的吗  你是人类吗
Is it true? Are you a human?

1132
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:27,000
是的
Yes.

1133
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,370
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1134
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,170
我不管  我还是想和你在一起
I don't care. I still want to be with you.

1135
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,720
这就难办了  因为我不想和你在一起
Well, tough. 'Cause I don't want to be with you.

1136
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,960
因为你是怪物  而我讨厌怪物
Because you're a monster. And I hate monsters.

1137
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,460
再见
Goodbye.

1138
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,470
求你别伤害我
Please don't hurt me!

1139
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,140
这都是你的错
This is all your fault!

1140
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,340
-我们要离开  -我再也不要回来了
- We're getting out of here. - I'm never coming back here.

1141
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,910
我好像闻到了人类的味道
I thought I smelt a human.

1142
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:12,610
无人区就是个笑话
"Human-free"? What a rip.

1143
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,830
他来了  德库拉伯爵来了
Oh. Here he comes. Count Crock-ula.

1144
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,930
我真庆幸眼睛被缝上了
I'm just glad my eyes are stitched shut,

1145
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:31,500
我连看都不想看...
'cause I don't even want to...

1146
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,670
梅维斯  宝贝  你在里面吗
Mavis, honey, are you in there?

1147
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,510
梅维斯  梅维斯
Mavis? Mavis?

1148
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,680
梅维斯  你在哪里
Mavis, where are you?

1149
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,450
梅维斯
Mavis?

1150
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,470
爸爸  能帮我个忙吗
Dad, can you do me a favor?

1151
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:13,870
能  当然能  宝贝  帮什么忙都行
Yes, yes, of course, darling. Anything.

1152
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,410
你能消去我的记忆吗
Will you erase my mind?

1153
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,350
不不不  我不会这么做的
No, no, no, no. No, I won't do that.

1154
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,320
有太多事情  我希望你能记住
There's too much I want you to remember.

1155
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,320
你说得对  爸爸  人类讨厌我们
You were right, Dad. The humans hate us.

1156
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,860
甜心  这里多的是合适的怪物
Sweetheart, there are so many eligible monsters out there.

1157
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,090
你还年轻
You're so young to...

1158
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,560
这是什么  你在看什么
What is it? What are you reading?

1159
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,880
{\an8}真爱

1160
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,740
{\an8}118岁生日祝福

1161
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,410
两只寂寞的蝙蝠在夜里相遇了
"Two lonely bats crashed in the night.

1162
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:53,580
他们命中注定  一见钟情
"They felt a Zing. Love at first sight.

1163
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:57,080
那一刻他们就意识到他们会终成眷属
"They knew right then they would be husband and wife.

1164
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:02,290
一辈子只有一次命中注定的相遇
"For a Zing only happens once in your life.

1165
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,130
你会遇到你的命中注定的  亲爱的
"Your Zing will come, my love.

1166
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,730
珍惜它
"Cherish it.

1167
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,060
爱你的  妈妈"
"Love, Mommy."

1168
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,120
我以为我们是命中注定  爸爸
I thought we Zinged, Dad.

1169
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,900
你和强尼吗
You and Johnny?

1170
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,870
我猜只有我这么想
I guess it was only me.

1171
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,080
但是你应该高兴  爸爸
But you should be happy, Dad.

1172
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,110
我再没有理由离开了
There's no reason for me to leave.

1173
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:28,180
也没有梦想了  就和你一样
I have no more dreams. I'm just like you now.

1174
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,610
{\an8}天堂

1175
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,540
玛莎  我到底做了什么
Martha, what have I done?

1176
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,250

这个小冰箱多少钱
What is this minibar charge?

1180
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,760
亲爱的  孩子们把小冰箱丢到窗外了
Honey, the kids threw the minibar out the window.

1181
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,160
-这是我们的错吗  -这个嘛

Excuse me, I got a couple of people to express mail.

1184
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,310
朋友们  拜托了  请停下来
Friends, please, stop.

1185
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,640
太晚了  骗子蝙蝠
It's too late, rat-bat!

1186
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,180
求你们了  求你们了
Please, I'm begging you.

1187
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:32,110
我需要你们帮我找到强尼
I need you to help me find Johnny.

1188
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,050
那个人类吗  他会杀了我们的
The human? He could've killed us!

1189
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,180
他碰了我的吉他
He touched my guitar!

1190
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:40,190
他把手放到我嘴里看会不会消失
He put his hand in my mouth to see if it would disappear.

1191
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,890
他让我吃了他们滑板车
He let me eat his scooter!

1192
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:47,360
我是说谎了
I know I lied.

1193
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,230
我错了
I was wrong.

1194
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,130
但你们要相信
But you have to believe this:

1195
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:54,630
强尼不是坏人
Johnny wasn't a bad guy.

1196
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:56,840
事实上
The truth is,

1197
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,840
我都不确定人类是不是还那么邪恶
I don't even know if humans are bad anymore.

1198
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,610
弗兰克  相信我  伙计  你明白的
Frank, come on, buddy. You understand.

1199
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,520
他没在跟你讲话
He's not talking to you.

1200
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,920
你先说人类很坏  现在他们又变好了
First you tell us humans are bad, now they're good.

1201
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,110
还有什么  颠倒是非
What else? Up is down,

1202
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:13,650
黑白不分  指鹿为马
cold is hot, gremlins don't smell.

1203
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:20,030
我喜欢强尼  不管他是不是我堂弟
I really liked Johnny, cousin or no.

1204
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,390
他会讲有趣的故事
He told fun stories.

1205
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,400
我想他们感受到了对方是自己的命中注定
I think they Zinged.

1206
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,960
命中注定了吗
They Zinged?

1207
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,900
但我阻止了他们的感情
But I got in the way.

1208
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,470
一辈子只有一次命中注定的相遇
You only Zing once in your life.

1209
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,870
-你短路了  -无所谓
- Oy, now you're short-circuiting. - I don't care!

1210
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,540
还等什么呢  去找强尼吧  走吧
Well, what are we doing? Let's get Johnny. Come on!

1211
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,550
我们走吧  一起来
Yeah, let's do it! Come on!

1212
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,370
现在去哪里
Okay, okay, where am I going?

1213
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:05,210
去人类世界  要不强尼就回不来了
The human world, before Johnny's gone forever.

1214
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,140
那太阳怎么办呢
But what about the sun?

1215
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,510
我不知道  但我们得行动起来
I don't know. I'll just have to roll.

1216
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:12,280
行动了  行动力啊
He just rolls. Rollability.

1217
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,010
我们跟着他的鞋印
So we follow his boot-prints.

1218
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,180
等找不到鞋印了  就靠你了  韦恩
When they run out, that's where you come in, Wayne.

1219
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,350
-我吗  -那里
- Me? - There!

1220
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,420
我就知道那个背包里会有东西掉出来的
Yes, I knew something would fall out of that backpack.

1221
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:28,190
臭死了
Yowch! That stinks!

1222
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,630
快施展你的法术吧
Work your magic.

1223
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,070
等等  你要我追踪气味吗
Wait, you want me to track the smell?

1224
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:34,500
不行  我的气味追踪能力早不行了
No. My sniffing tracking days are way behind me.

1225
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,440
你知道我换了多少块尿布了吗
Do you know how many diapers I've changed?

1226
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,740
你知道我的鼻子被多少便便熏过了吗
How many number twos have destroyed this thing?

1227
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,310
可是
But...

1228
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,790
小心点  看着路
Hey! Take it easy! Watch it!

1229
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,420
坐
Sit.

1230
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,530
闻  我说了  闻
Smell. I said smell.

1231
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,830
不是闻我  闻T恤  T恤
Not me, the shirt! The shirt!

1232
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,740
还有听你话的孩子吗
Do any of your kids still respect you?

1233
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:12,440
让我想想  有了
Mm, give me a second. Oh, yeah.

1234
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,440
维尼  站到前排中间来

1235
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:28,250

He got into a car. A '86 Fiat.

1236
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,330
车子的变速器得修修了
It needs a little transmission work,

1237
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,960
不过其他的还行
but otherwise okay.

1238
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,600

1242
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,100
他点了素食餐
He ordered the vegetarian meal.

1243
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,710
好的  谢谢你  小可爱
Okay, thank you, cutie.

1244
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,480
听着  都回妈妈那儿去
Now, all of you, go back to your mother!

1245
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:58,950
羊
Sheep!

1246
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,560
击个掌  别让我一个人挂着嘛
High five! Don't leave me hanging.

1247
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,070
-一大群羊  -这次就交给我了
- Lots of sheep! - I got this one.

1248
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,180
怎么啦  现在没有羊挡路了  我们走
What? Now there's no sheep in the road. Let's go.

1249
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,050
真恶心  伙计
That was pretty sick, man.

1250
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,520
你还吃羊排呢  不都一样吗
You eat lamb chops, it's the same thing.

1251
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,920
没时间争执这些了  快  我们走
We don't have time for this. Come on, let's move it!

1252
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,090
看  人类
Look, a human.

1253
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:43,630
欢迎来到特兰西瓦尼亚
Welcome to Transylvania!

1254
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:49,170
那是幻觉
That was trippy.

1255
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,470
怪物嘉年华
Monster Festival?

1256
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:52,470
{\an8}怪物嘉年华

1257
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,440
怪物嘉年华是什么
What's a Monster Festival?

1258
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,860
{\an8}我们爱德库拉

1259
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,770
{\an8}高举火把  科学怪人

1260
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,380
他们知道我们要来吗
Did they know we were coming?

1261
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,110
他们喜欢我们
They like us?

1262
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,510
真的吗
Really?

1263
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,150
请问  你知道怎么去机场吗
Excuse me? Do you know the best way to the airport?

1264
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,600
知道  德库拉伙计
Yes, fellow Dracula.

1265
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,350
只有一条路  不拉不拉不拉
There's only one way. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1266
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:39,550
但是都被堵住了  我们赶不上了
But it's all blocked. We'll never make it in time.

1267
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:42,190
你该提前一个小时出门  不拉不拉不拉
You should have left an hour earlier. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1268
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:45,630
我不说不拉不拉不拉的
I do not say "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

1269
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,990
行  我们徒步走过去吧
All right, let's just run through it on foot.

1270
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,470
德库拉  这个可以保护你
Drac, this'll protect you.

1271
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,100
不拉不拉不拉
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1272
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,270
要是他们知道自己在跟
Imagine if that guy knew

1273
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:00,670
真德库拉说话会怎么样呢
he was talking to the real Drac.

1274
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,580
会撒丫子逃跑吧
He'd run for the hills!

1275
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,740
等等  等等
Hold it, now. Hold it, now.

1276
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,750
你说的有道理
That sounds spot on.

1277
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,080
但要想让他们知道我们真的是怪物
But the only way they'd

1278
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,580
我们就得露出真面目
know the real us is if we show the real us.

1279
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,350
应该有用的
This could work.

1280
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:13,420
你是说  吓唬他们
You mean, like, scare them?

1281
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,920
我几个世纪都没吓过人了
We haven't scared people in centuries.

1282
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,090
我觉得我都不会吓人了
I don't even think I have it in me anymore.

1283
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:21,790
我不行了  我不行了
I got nothing. I really got nothing.

1284
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,200
不如加点小道具吧
Let's just move this along.

1285
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,070
火啊  火啊
Fire! Fire!

1286
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,210
火啊
Fire!

1287
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,720
我在吓唬你们
I'm trying to scare you!

1288
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,630
我是真的弗兰克斯坦
The real Frankenstein!

1289
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,630
我们知道  我们爱你
We know! We love you!

1290
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,960
可以给我的火炬签个名吗
Can you sign my torch?

1291
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,160
听着  首先要说的是
Listen, before anything else,

1292
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,670
下面的那位是真的德库拉
down there's the real Dracula!

1293
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,100
拿点证据出来
Prove it.

1294
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:08,110
好吧  继续说
All right. Continue.

1295
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,810
德库拉的女儿恋爱了  他得赶到机场去
Drac's daughter's in love, and he's got to get to the airport!

1296
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:14,210
但他没法通过拥挤的人群
And he can't get through this crowd!

1297
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,270
为什么不飞过去呢
Why doesn't he fly?

1298
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:17,780
有太阳啊  白痴  他是吸血鬼
The sun, you idiot. He's a vampire.

1299
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:20,690
没错  谢谢你  书呆子妖怪
That's right. Thank you, Monster Nerd.

1300
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:23,780
如果你们真的是我们的朋友
So, people, if you really are our friends,

1301
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,630
人们  请为他开辟一条通路吧
clear a path for the man!

1302
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:28,750
好  所有的德库拉  站好队
Okay. All Draculas, line up.

1303
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,130
不拉不拉不拉
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1304
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,140
其他的人  撑起斗篷
Everyone else, lift the capes.

1305
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,240
保护我们的朋友  不拉不拉不拉
Protect our friend. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1306
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,150
这一切都是为了你  朋友
It's all for you, buddy.

1307
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,480
去吧
Go ahead.

1308
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,580
祝你好运  去找他们
Good luck! Go get 'em!

1309
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:52,890
去吧  德库拉  去吧
Go, Drac, go!

1310
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,590
去吧  德库拉  去吧  德库拉
Go, Drac! Go, Drac!

1311
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,120
去吧  德库拉
Go, Drac!

1312
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,990
去吧  德库拉
Go, Drac!

1313
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,430
去吧  德库拉
Go, Drac!

1314
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:06,070
找到他们
Go get 'em!

1315
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:09,540
去吧  德库拉  去吧
Go, Drac, go!

1316
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,810
我们爱你  德库拉
We love you, Dracula!

1317
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:28,820
别无选择了
There's no choice.

1318
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,830
我必须做到
Okay. Okay, I must do this.

1319
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:33,120
乔纳森  乔纳森  听得到我说话吗
Jonathan. Jonathan, can you hear me?

1320
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,360
告诉我  你想变成吸血鬼吗
Tell me, do you drm of being a vampire?

1321
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,090
我们居然被拍成这样  受不了
This is how we're represented. Unbelievable.

1322
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,060
乔纳森  乔纳森
Jonathan. Jonathan.

1323
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,330
听得到吗
Can you hear me?

1324
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:45,060
蝙蝠
Whoa! Bat!

1325
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:47,670
等等  他在说话  德库拉  是你吗
Wait, it's talking. Dracula? Is that you?

1326
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,640
德库拉
Huh? Dracula.

1327
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,370
我听不清
I can't understand you.

1328
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:56,540
什么  我的手在黑鞋子里
What? My hand's in a tan shoe?

1329
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:00,680
什么  日本吃羊汤
What? Japan's eating lamb stew?

1330
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,280
你知道你在冒烟吗
Hey, do you know you're smoking?

1331
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,790
借过  抱歉  借过
Pardon me. Sorry, excuse me.

1332
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,290
借过
Whoa! Excuse me.

1333
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:30,610
怎么回事  蝙蝠怎么飞这么高
What the heck? How'd a bat get up this high?

1334
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:32,740
伙计们  我去把安全带指示灯打开
Folks, I'm gonna turn on the seat belt sign.

1335
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,150
只是以防万一
Just a precaution while we...

1336
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,060
下面请听
While we hear a special announcement

1337
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,720
我对亲爱的朋友乔纳森的特别公告
for my dear friend Jonathan.

1338
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,190
德库拉
Dracula?

1339
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:47,690
亲爱的孩子  我犯了一个大错
My dear boy, I have made a terrible mistake.

1340
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,360
我想把我的宝贝留在我身边
I was trying to keep my baby to myself,

1341
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:54,500
因为我知道我会永远保护她
because I knew I would always protect her.

1342
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,980
但我现在意识到
But I realize now,

1343
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:59,910
孩子们需要自己去经历人生
children need to discover things for themselves.

1344
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:03,640
他们会磕磕碰碰  有哭有笑
They'll stumble and fall, laugh and cry,

1345
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,780
但这就是生活
but such is life.

1346
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,950
事实上  你和梅维斯是天生一对
The truth is, you and Mavis are meant to be.

1347
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,820
你们命中注定
You Zinged.

1348
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,790
如果她一定要把自己的信任交付给谁
If she must give her trust to someone else,

1349
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:17,060
我很感激那是你  乔纳森
I'm thankful that it is you, Jonathan.

1350
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:21,290
我希望你能听到这些话  原谅我
I hope you can hear me and forgive me.

1351
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:39,880
伙计们  我们要迅速返航  加满燃料
Okay, folks, we're going to make a quick turnaround to refuel,

1352
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,780
然后再继续旅程
and then we'lle back on our way.

1353
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,550
少发牢骚  我在这儿都要烧着了
Quit your whining! I'm burning up out here!

1354
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,130
爸爸
Dad?

1355
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:06,370
我没事  只是有点晒伤
I'm fine. I'm just a little sunburnt.

1356
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,080
宝贝
Honey,

1357
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:16,120
我一直以为看你离开是最糟糕的
I always thought the worst thing ever would be seeing you go.

1358
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,790
但事实上  看到你不开心才是最糟糕的
But the worst is seeing you unhappy.

1359
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:22,390
小梅  我希望你有自己的生活
Mavey, I want you to live your life.

1360
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,830
我不知道要怎么做
I don't know how I'm supposed to do that.

1361
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,930
妈妈已经给了你生日礼物
You know, Mommy already gave you her birthday present.

1362
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,870
现在我把我的礼物给你吧
Can I now give you mine?

1363
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,000
我还要这个包干什么呢
What do I need this for?

1364
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,210
这个包还附带赠品
Oh, it comes with an accessory.

1365
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,540
-是你  -是你
- You? - You.

1366
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:46,880
你怎么回来了
Why are you back?

1367
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,820
因为你是我的命中注定  梅维斯
'Cause you're my Zing, Mavis.

1368
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,020
我是你的命中注定吗
I'm your Zing?

1369
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:58,090
但是你说你讨厌怪物
But you told me you hate monsters.

1370
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:01,160
那个嘛  我是怕不这么说
Yeah, well, I was afraid your dad was gonna

1371
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,130
你爸爸就会吸干我的血
suck all the blood out of my body if I didn't say that.

1372
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:05,230
我才不会
I wouldn't have...

1373
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:07,070
他说的没错  我会吸干他的血
No, he's right, I would have done that.

1374
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,970
-爸爸  -我错了  小甜心
- Dad. - I was wrong, Devil-chops.

1375
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:15,540
你是说真的吗  爸爸
Do you really mean it, Dad?

1376
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,540
{\an8}天堂  你会在夏威夷找到天堂

1377
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,310
去建造你自己的天堂吧
Go make your own paradise.

1378
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,820
我们能再吻一次吗
Can we try that kiss over again?

1379
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,520
可以吧
I think we can.

1380
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:36,000
抱歉  我只是  我得习惯这个

1382

{\an8}生日快乐  梅维斯

1383
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,440
停下来  停下来
Stop! Stop!

1384
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,680
我以为是真爱  结果只是暧昧
I thought I found a love but she was just a fling

1385
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:00,520
然后我遇到了一个女孩  感觉大有不同
And then I met a girl and felt a different thing

1386
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,590
就像正中红心  魂牵梦萦
It's like you're hit in the ring Like you're pulled by a string

1387
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,320
小鹿乱撞  无法呼吸
Can't breathe like you're choking on a chicken wing

1388
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,430
不经意间到来的爱  让我想放声歌唱
It was a thing called a Zig and I wanted to sing

1389
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:08,360
听那个人的歌声  他叫斯汀
And listen to ballads of the man named Sting

1390
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,360
美女望向你的眼眸  好似春日降临
Lady looks in your eyes and it's suddenly spring

1391
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,630
就如狮子王里的娜娜看见辛巴
Like when Nala looked at Simba in The Lion King

1392
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:18,100
空气中擦出火花  我却毫无觉察
Zinging in the air and I don't have a care

1393
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:22,510
我在其中翱翔荡漾
I'm winging from the Zing that we shared

1394
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,140
在雨中擦出火花  痛楚都消逝不见
Zinging in the rain Now I'm feeling no pain

1395
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,180
此刻就应欢庆
It's a real tie for celebrating

1396
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,250
因为你是我的命中注定
'Cause you're my Zing

1397
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,520
德库拉  准备好来一段了吗
Drac, you ready to throw down?

1398
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,720
不不  我只是靠近点  听得更清楚
No, no, I just came closer to hear you better.

1399
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,730
来嘛  试试吧
Come on, just give it a try.

1400
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:41,990
好吧  就稍微试试吧
All right, maybe just a little.

1401
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,060
从这里到北京的命中注定  我们在聆听
So listen all you Zingers from here to Beijing

1402
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,660
一旦相爱  就应相守一生
You better crash the box spring Get ready to cling

1403
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,730
如果爱就是金钱  你就会歌唱起钱币
'Cause if love was money you'd be yelling cha-ching

1404
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:48,420
有了命中注定
Next to a Zing

1405
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,440
丘比特之箭也不过蜜蜂一刺
Cupid's arrow's a little bee sting

1406
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,570
是真爱是绝配那就是命中注定
It was a Zing and a zag and a zingidy-dee

1407
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,510
只有一位美女是我的命中注定
And there was only one lady in the Zing for me

1408
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:56,080
你要知道  最好的珠宝

是那婚戒

1410
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,380
空气中满是火花
Zinging in the air

1411
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:05,720
可我毫无觉察
Now I don't have a care

1412
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,020
我在其中翱翔荡漾
I'm winging from the Zing that we shared

1413
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,460
在雨中擦出火花  痛楚都消逝不见
